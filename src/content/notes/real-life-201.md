You grow up being told you were "the special one",  
and that "the world revolved around you."

Then you come of age, decide to start a business and the first thing you're told
is "why should people care?"  
Hey hold on, "I thought I was the centre of the universe?"

Welcome to Real Life 201.  
The world doesn't give a fuck about you unless you force it to.  
The world won't give a fuck about you unless you make it care.

Go out there and create change.
