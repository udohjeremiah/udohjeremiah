I'm not a pedophile, but I am a technophile.

I abhor people who are sexually attracted to children, but I revere people who
are enthusiastic about new technology.

The world is a horrible place because of pedophiles, but humanity would go back
to the Stone Age without technophiles.

Pedophiles make headlines because bad news travels faster, but technophiles
(not tech billionaires) who drive the human species forward are left in
obscurity.

To all the technophiles of history, those with us and those no longer with us, I
salute you.  
I salute you for being brave enough to dedicate your life to what people once
dismissed as "hobbies."  
I salute you for wearing the badge of honour for your passion at a time when the
most common example of a "hobbyist" was "a computer hobbyist."  
I salute you for not letting the naysayers and doomsayers of technology get the
best of you; otherwise, what would I be doing with my life right now?  
I salute you for fighting the good fight so that I can build on your work today
and enjoy the fame, money, and social acclaim you never received in your time.

To all the technophiles of today, who don't let big media, social networks, or
public sentiment dictate what's worth their time, I salute you as well.  
I salute you for letting your passion be your driving force.  
I salute you for the coffees and late-night coding sessions.  
I salute you for the open-source work for which you so often receive no
recognition.  
I salute you for wanting to make the world a better place through technology.  
My kids will one day look back on your work and etch your names in their hearts
as the great ones of history.

To all technophiles out there, please keep being your authentic selves.
