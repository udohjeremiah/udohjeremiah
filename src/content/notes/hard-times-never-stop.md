To everyone going through tough times,  
I just want you to know this: it won’t stop.  
Tough times will always be there.

The whole point of life is to enjoy the ride while it lasts,  
no matter how bumpy it is.

Suffering is inherent to human existence. Make peace with it.

On your deathbed, only three groups of people will remain by your side:

1. Your wife and children, to whom you gave your all.  
2. Your siblings, with whom you shared your childhood.  
3. The friends you turned into brothers and sisters.

Protect these people with everything you’ve got.  
Because in reality, they're the only ones you've got.
