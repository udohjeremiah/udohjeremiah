title: The world always demands an explanation
description: But do I really owe her one?

I made a decision. It didn't sit well with you. "But why?" you asked. For crying
out loud, I'm an adult! I only made a personal decision, and it didn't cause
anyone harm. But the decision didn't "sit" well with you, so I have to explain
why.

When I make a decision that you like, you don't pause for a moment to ask:
"Hold on, but why?". If you're okay with it, I'm given a checkmark and allowed
to pass. Otherwise, I get the incessant "But why?"

I don't owe you that bloody explanation just because my personal decision didn't
sit well with you. But we're social creatures, so you've got to learn how to
live in the world. That's the classic argument, but it's fine. So I finally get
to tell you why I made that decision:

> I made the decision based on my values that I've defined for myself

Now I wish that had settled it all. But no, it doesn't. You go on to boldly
claim, "That's not right". Really? Is this how "social" we've become? That we'd
go as far not only to question people's personal decisions but also their
values?

I don't think that's cool. Let people be! If it doesn't "sit" well with you,
maybe you've got to "sit" down and ask yourself "but why", and not the other way
round.

I don't owe the world an explanation because I made a personal decision that
didn't sit well with the mainstream. If I had to identify as a contrarian just
so you would get the message, I'd gladly do it.

I don't want to waste these productive years going around expending energy
explaining why I did what I did to make my life worth living, just because it
didn't sit well with the majority. Because in the end, it won't matter.
