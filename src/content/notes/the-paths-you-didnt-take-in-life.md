You'll always wonder about the paths you didn't take in life.  
And there are literally thousands of them.

To go to school or not go at all.  
That girl or this one.  
To marry or not marry.  
To have kids or not have kids.  
That job or this one.  
That business idea or that one.

Here's my one cent.  
As a human choose your trade-offs and make peace with them.  
Choose your trade-offs and live peacefully with them.  
Choose your trade-offs and go to bed and sleep joyfully with them.

Because the reality is that you can't have it all.
