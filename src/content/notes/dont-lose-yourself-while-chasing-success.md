In your race to succeed in life, don't lose yourself.

In your race to succeed, don't abandon your family.  
Don't forget those who knew you when you had anything.

In your race to succeed, don't burn bridges you don't need to burn.  
Not everyone is your enemy. Not everyone is in your way.

In your race to succeed, don't become an asshole.  
Ambition without humility turns you into someone nobody respects.

In your race to succeed, don't forget how to love.  
Love keeps you human. Love keeps you grounded.

Success means nothing if it costs you your character, your relationship, and
your ability to look at yourself without shame.

Yes, win.  
But don't lose who you are in the process.
