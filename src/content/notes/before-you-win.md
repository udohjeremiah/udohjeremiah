Before you win, they ask why you're still awake at night.  
After you succeed, they say, "Yeah, it must've felt just right."

Before you win, they doubt the road you chose to take.  
After you succeed, they claim it was an easy break.

Before you win, they warn you not to dream so big.  
After you succeed, they say they always knew you'd rise.

Before you win, they question every step you make.  
After you succeed, they call your courage luck—not faith.

Before you win, they laugh at how much you invest.  
After you succeed, they ask how you knew it was the best move.

Before you win, your struggle goes unseen.  
After you succeed, your story suddenly sounds routine.

Before you win, your effort looks like foolish strain.  
After you succeed, they say the stars always had your name.

Before you win, you walk alone—unheard.  
After you succeed, they repeat your every word.

Before you win, everything you say sounds foolish.  
After you win, every joke you tell is funny, every post you make is
"motivational," and even your mistakes? They'll say there was wisdom in them.
