Someday, we will all die,  
and on that day, people will cry.

The next day, we will be buried,  
and on that day, people will lament.

The second day, people will mourn.  
But by the third day, people will move on.

Because no matter how special you are,  
life somehow has to continue without you.

So make the most of your one wild life.
