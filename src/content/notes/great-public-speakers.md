You don't have to listen to every podcast about communication.  
You don't have to watch every YouTube video on public speaking.  
You don't even have to listen to me....  

All you really need is:

- a camera,
- the willingness to hit record and just blab for the next 3 minutes for the
  next 365 days,
- and the grit to come back and see what you did—or didn't—do right.

That is what creates great public speakers.
