Life is a mystery moving forward.  
It's science looking back.

I know—you're working, but nothing is showing for it right now.  
You're building, but it doesn't add up or make sense yet.  
Worry not.

Stay calm and focus on what's in front of you.  
The universe will meet you halfway.  
And when it does, look back on your journey to understand what made the wins possible—and what caused the losses.

The tragic irony is this: life must be lived forward, but it only makes sense in reverse.
