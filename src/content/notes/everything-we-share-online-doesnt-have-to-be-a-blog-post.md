title: Everything we share online doesn't have to be a blog post
description: The internet has space for raw, unrefined, personal thoughts too.

There are those fleeting moments when I catch a thought and want to share it
with the world. But I can't. I can't because it doesn't meet the blogging
standard:

- It's too short; so short that you'll finish reading it under 60 seconds.
- It doesn't aim to solve any problem for you; it's just a thought worth
  sharing.
- It's too informal; so informal that you might consider it private life.
- It doesn't follow a structure; each thought stands on its own with no
  association to those before it or those that will come after.

After some thinking, I've concluded that not everything I want to share on the
internet should be a blog post. So, if it's not going to be a blog post, then
what would it be? **A NOTE!**

A note is just this little piece of thought, idea, saying, etc., that resonated,
sparked a fire, or left me thinking deeply. If I found it profound, then others
might too.

A list of all my notes will be found on the [notes](/notes) page of this site,
and you can click on each one to read it. Feel free to reach out to me if you
connected with one of these notes. Thanks for reading.
