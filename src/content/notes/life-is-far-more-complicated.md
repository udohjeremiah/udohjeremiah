I thought that by now I'd have my life figured out, but I was dead wrong.  
Life is far more complicated than I ever imagined.

Growing up, I planned my life very carefully.  
I believed that before 30, everything would make sense.

I told myself:

I would start primary school at 6 and finish at 12.  
I started at 6 and finished at 11.  
Good prediction.

I would start secondary school at 12 and finish at 18.  
I started at 12, failed WAEC, passed NECO, and finished at 19.  
Slightly off.

I would enter university at 18 and graduate at 22.  
I didn't gain admission. I went to a polytechnic at 19, later entered university at 21, and graduated at 24.  
Very bad prediction.

I would get a job at 23, be settled by 26, and get married at 28.  
Well...that prediction is already falling apart 😂.

This is the reality of the world we live in.  
Life is not a straight line, no matter how badly we want it to be.

It's a zig-zag.  
Some of your plans will work out. Many won't.  
And that's okay.

The truth is, nobody has it all figured out.  
Nobody ever has.

We're all just moving forward, navigating tension, confusion, uncertainty, and complexity as best as we can.

So don't fall for the trap of a simplistic view of life.  
Life is far messier than the perfect pictures we're sold.

And that doesn't mean you're failing.  
It just means you're human.
