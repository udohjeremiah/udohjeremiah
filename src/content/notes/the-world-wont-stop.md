The world can’t stop for you. Yes, it can’t, no matter how special you are.  
The world won’t stop for you.  Yes, it won’t, no matter what you did for her.  

It’s not because the world doesn’t love you.  
Neither is it because you didn’t do much for her.  
She's not that evil.  
It can’t stop, because it just can’t stop.  
It won’t stop, because it just won’t stop.

It’s that simple.

The world has been put in play.  
We don’t know who or how it started, but it’s already in play.  
The rules of how it works have been set.  
Characters come in this game, and characters go out of it.  
All in all, no one gets the opportunity to see the end of the game.

No matter how great or wretched you are,  
No matter how strong or lazy you are,  
No matter how mighty or small you are,  
No matter how loving or wicked you are,  
No matter who you are,  
The world won’t stop for a second for you.

So, make the most of your time here.  
Live your life to the fullest.  
Enjoy every moment of it.  
Because when you finally close your eyes and draw that last breath of yours,  
The world won’t stop.
