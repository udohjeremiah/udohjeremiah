This is the fifth article (part 5) in my series about **"What You May Not Know About TypeScript."** You might want to
start reading from [part 1](https://www.udohjeremiah.com/blog/what-you-may-not-know-about-typescript-part-1) to get an
introduction to what led me to write this. With that said, let's get started.

## In TypeScript, declaration merging for namespaces have non-exported members only visible in the original (un-merged) namespace.

This means that after merging, merged members that came from other declarations cannot see non-exported members.

We can see this more clearly in this example:

```ts
namespace Animal {
  let haveMuscles = true;

  export function animalsHaveMuscles() {
    return haveMuscles;
  }
}

namespace Animal {
  export function doAnimalsHaveMuscles() {
    // [!code error:3]
    return haveMuscles;
    // [!not-code] Cannot find name 'haveMuscles'.
  }
}
```

Because `haveMuscles{:ts}` is not exported, only the `animalsHaveMuscles{:ts}` function that shares the same un-merged
namespace can see the symbol. The `doAnimalsHaveMuscles{:ts}` function, even though it's part of the merged
`Animal{:ts}` namespace can not see this un-exported member.

## In TypeScript, namespaces are flexible enough to merge with other declarations.

To do so, the namespace declaration must follow the declaration it will merge with. The resulting declaration has
properties of both declaration types. TypeScript uses this capability to model some patterns in JavaScript and other
programming languages.

Merging namespaces with classes gives the user a way of describing inner classes:

```ts
class Album {
  label: Album.AlbumLabel;
}

namespace Album {
  export class AlbumLabel {}
}
```

The visibility rules for merged members are the same as when merging namespaces, so we must export the `AlbumLabel{:ts}`
class for the merged class to see it. The result is a class managed inside of another class. You can also use namespaces
to add more static members to an existing class.

In addition to the pattern of inner classes, you may also be familiar with the JavaScript practice of creating a
function and then extending the function further by adding properties to the function. TypeScript uses declaration
merging to build up definitions like this in a type-safe way.

```ts
function buildLabel(name: string): string {
  return buildLabel.prefix + name + buildLabel.suffix;
}

namespace buildLabel {
  export let suffix = "";
  export let prefix = "Hello, ";
}

console.log(buildLabel("Sam Smith"));
// [!not-code] Hello, Sam Smith
```

Similarly, namespaces can be used to extend enums with static members:

```ts
enum Color {
  red = 1,
  green = 2,
  blue = 4,
}

namespace Color {
  export function mixColor(colorName: string) {
    if (colorName == "yellow") {
      return Color.red + Color.green;
    } else if (colorName == "white") {
      return Color.red + Color.green + Color.blue;
    } else if (colorName == "magenta") {
      return Color.red + Color.blue;
    } else if (colorName == "cyan") {
      return Color.green + Color.blue;
    } else {
      return;
    }
  }
}
```

## In TypeScript, classes can not merge with other classes or with variables.

```ts
// [!code error:3]
class A {
  // [!not-code] Duplicate identifier 'A'.
  x = 0;
  y = 0;
  z = 0;
}

// [!code error:3]
class A {
  // [!not-code] Duplicate identifier 'A'.
  z = 0;
}
```

For information on mimicking class merging, see the
[Mixins in TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/mixins.html).

## In TypeScript, unlike JavaScript, you can use module augmentation to merge two modules.

Although JavaScript modules do not support merging, you can patch existing objects by importing and updating them.

Let's look at a toy `Observable{:ts}` example:

```ts title="observable.ts"
export class Observable<T> {
  // ...
}
```

```ts title="map.ts"
import { Observable } from "./observable";

Observable.prototype.map = function (f) {
  // ...
};
```

This works in TypeScript too, but the compiler doesn't know about `Observable.prototype.map{:ts}`. You can use
**module augmentation** to tell the compiler about it:

```ts title="observable.ts"
export class Observable<T> {
  // ...
}
```

```ts title="map.ts"
import { Observable } from "./observable";

declare module "./observable" {
  interface Observable<T> {
    map<U>(f: (x: T) => U): Observable<U>;
  }
}

Observable.prototype.map = function (f) {
  // ...
};
```

```ts title="consumer.ts"
import "./map";
import { Observable } from "./observable";

let o: Observable<number>;
o.map((x) => x.toFixed());
```

The module name is resolved the same way as module specifiers in `import{:ts}`/`export{:ts}`. Then the declarations in
an augmentation are merged as if they were declared in the same file as the original.

However, there are two limitations to keep in mind:

1. You can't declare new top-level declarations in the augmentation â€” just patches to existing declarations.
2. Default exports also cannot be augmented, only named exports (since you need to augment an export by its exported
   name, and the default is a reserved word - see
   [#14080](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/14080) for details).

## In TypeScript, you can add declarations to the global scope from inside a module.

```ts title="observable.ts"
export class Observable<T> {
  // ...
}

declare global {
  interface Array<T> {
    toObservable(): Observable<T>;
  }
}

Array.prototype.toObservable = function () {
  // ...
};
```

Global augmentations have the same behaviour and limits as module augmentations.

## In TypeScript, numeric enums can be mixed in computed and constant members.

Each enum member has a value associated with it which can be either constant or computed. An enum member is considered
constant if:

- It is the first member in the enum and it has no initializer, in which case it's assigned the value `0{:ts}`:

  ```ts
  // E.X is constant:
  enum E {
    X,
  }

  // [!code error:3]
  E.X = 2;
  // [!not-code] Cannot assign to 'X' because it is a read-only property.
  ```

- It does not have an initializer and the preceding enum member was a numeric constant. In this case, the value of the
  current enum member will be the value of the preceding enum member plus one.

  ```ts
  // All enum members in 'E1' and 'E2' are constant.
  enum E1 {
    X,
    Y,
    Z,
  }

  enum E2 {
    A = 1,
    B,
    C,
  }
  ```

- The enum member is initialized with a constant enum expression. A constant enum expression is a subset of TypeScript
  expressions that can be fully evaluated at compile time. An expression is a constant enum expression if it is:

  1. a literal enum expression (basically a string literal or a numeric literal)
  2. a reference to a previously defined constant enum member (which can originate from a different enum)
  3. a parenthesized constant enum expression
  4. one of the `+{:ts}`, `-{:ts}`, `~{:ts}` unary operators applied to constant enum expression
  5. `+{:ts}`, `-{:ts}`, `*{:ts}`, `/{:ts}`, `%{:ts}`, `<<{:ts}`, `>>{:ts}`, `>>>{:ts}`, `&{:ts}`, `|{:ts}`, `^{:ts}`
     binary operators with constant enum expressions as operands

It is a compile time error for constant enum expressions to be evaluated to `NaN{:ts}` or `Infinity{:ts}`.

In all other cases, enum member is considered computed.

```ts
enum FileAccess {
  // constant members
  None,
  Read = 1 << 1,
  Write = 1 << 2,
  ReadWrite = Read | Write,

  // computed member
  G = "123".length,
}
```

## In TypeScript, enums without initializers either need to be first or have to come after numeric enums initialized with numeric constants or other constant enum members.

In other words, the following isn't allowed:

```ts
enum E {
  A = Math.round(Math.random()),
  // [!code error:3]
  B,
  // [!not-code] Enum member must have initializer.
}
```

## In TypeScript, enums can be mixed with string and numeric members.

Technically enums can be mixed with string and numeric members - they are called heterogenous enums, but it's not clear
why you would ever want to do so:

```ts
enum BooleanLikeHeterogeneousEnum {
  No = 0,
  Yes = "YES",
}
```

Unless you're trying to take advantage of JavaScript's runtime behaviour in a clever way, it's advised that you don't do
this.

## In TypeScript, when all members in an enum have literal enum values, some special semantics come into play.

There is a special subset of constant enum members that aren't calculated: literal enum members. A literal enum member
is a constant enum member with no initialized value, or with values that are initialized to

- any string literal (e.g. `"foo"{:ts}`, `"bar"{:ts}`, `"baz"{:ts}`)
- any numeric literal (e.g. `1{:ts}`, `100{:ts}`)
- a unary minus applied to any numeric literal (e.g. `-1{:ts}`, `-100{:ts}`)

When all members in an enum have literal enum values, some special semantics come into play.

The first is that enum members also become types as well! For example, we can say that certain members can only have the
value of an enum member:

```ts
enum ShapeKind {
  Circle,
  Square,
}

interface Circle {
  kind: ShapeKind.Circle;
  radius: number;
}

interface Square {
  kind: ShapeKind.Square;
  sideLength: number;
}

let c: Circle = {
  // [!code error:3]
  kind: ShapeKind.Square,
  // [!not-code] Type 'ShapeKind.Square' is not assignable to type 'ShapeKind.Circle'.
  radius: 100,
};
```

The other change is that enum types themselves effectively become a union of each enum member. With union enums, the
type system is able to leverage the fact that it knows the exact set of values that exist in the enum itself. Because of
that, TypeScript can catch bugs where we might be comparing values incorrectly. For example:

```ts
enum E {
  Foo,
  Bar,
}

function f(x: E) {
  // [!code error:3]
  if (x !== E.Foo || x !== E.Bar) {
    // [!not-code] This comparison appears to be unintentional because the types 'E.Foo' and 'E.Bar' have no overlap.
    // ...
  }
}
```

In that example, we first checked whether `x{:ts}` was not `E.Foo{:ts}`. If that check succeeds, then our `||{:ts}` will
short-circuit, and the body of the `if{:ts}` will run. However, if the check didn't succeed, then `x{:ts}` can only be
`E.Foo{:ts}`, so it doesn't make sense to see whether it's not equal to `E.Bar{:ts}`.

## In TypeScript, enums are real objects that exist at runtime.

For example, the following enum:

```ts
enum E {
  X,
  Y,
  Z,
}
```

can actually be passed around to functions:

```ts
enum E {
  X,
  Y,
  Z,
}

function f(obj: { X: number }) {
  return obj.X;
}

// Works, since 'E' has a property named 'X' which is a number.
f(E);
```

## In TypeScript, use `keyof typeof{:ts}` to get a type that represents all enum keys as strings

Even though enums are real objects that exist at runtime, the `keyof{:ts}` keyword works differently than you might
expect for typical objects. Instead, use `keyof typeof{:ts}` to get a type representing all enum keys as strings:

```ts
enum LogLevel {
  ERROR,
  WARN,
  INFO,
  DEBUG,
}

/**
 * This is equivalent to:
 * type LogLevelStrings = 'ERROR' | 'WARN' | 'INFO' | 'DEBUG';
 */
type LogLevelStrings = keyof typeof LogLevel;

function printImportant(key: LogLevelStrings, message: string) {
  const num = LogLevel[key];

  if (num <= LogLevel.WARN) {
    console.log("Log level key is:", key);
    console.log("Log level value is:", num);
    console.log("Log level message is:", message);
  }
}

printImportant("ERROR", "This is a message");
// [!not-code] Log level key is: ERROR
// [!not-code] Log level value is: 0
// [!not-code] Log level message is: This is a message
```

## In TypeScript, numeric enums members also get a reverse mapping from enum values to enum names.

In addition to creating an object with property names for members, numeric enums members also get a reverse mapping from
enum values to enum names. For example, in this example:

```ts
enum Enum {
  A,
}

let a = Enum.A;
let nameOfA = Enum[a];
console.log(nameOfA);
// [!not-code] "A"
```

TypeScript compiles this down to the following JavaScript:

```ts
"use strict";
var Enum;
(function (Enum) {
  Enum[(Enum["A"] = 0)] = "A";
})(Enum || (Enum = {}));
let a = Enum.A;
let nameOfA = Enum[a];
console.log(nameOfA);
```

In this generated code, an enum is compiled into an object that stores both forward (`name{:ts}` -> `value{:ts}`) and
reverse (`value{:ts}` -> `name{:ts}`) mappings. References to other enum members are always emitted as property accesses
and never inlined.

Keep in mind that string enum members do not get a reverse mapping generated at all.

## In TypeScript, you can use ambient enums to describe the shape of already existing enum types.

```ts
declare enum Enum {
  A = 1,
  B,
  C = 2,
}
```

One important difference between ambient and non-ambient enums is that, in regular enums, members that don't have an
initializer will be considered constant if their preceding enum member is considered constant. By contrast, an ambient
(and non-const) enum member that does not have an initializer is always considered computed.

## In TypeScript, it's possible to use `const{:ts}` enums.

In most cases, enums are a perfectly valid solution. However sometimes requirements are tighter. To avoid paying the
cost of extra generated code and additional indirection when accessing enum values, it's possible to use `const{:ts}`
enums. Const enums are defined using the `const{:ts}` modifier on our enums:

```ts
const enum Enum {
  A = 1,
  B = A * 2,
}
```

Const enums can only use constant enum expressions and unlike regular enums they are completely removed during
compilation. Const enum members are inlined at use sites. This is possible since const enums cannot have computed
members.

```ts
const enum Direction {
  Up,
  Down,
  Left,
  Right,
}

let directions = [
  Direction.Up,
  Direction.Down,
  Direction.Left,
  Direction.Right,
];
```

in generated code will become

```ts
"use strict";
let directions = [
  0 /* Direction.Up */, 1 /* Direction.Down */, 2 /* Direction.Left */,
  3 /* Direction.Right */,
];
```

Inlining enum values is straightforward at first, but comes with subtle implications. These pitfalls pertain to ambient
const enums only (basically const enums in `.d.ts{:ts}` files) and sharing them between projects, but if you are
publishing or consuming `.d.ts{:ts}` files, these pitfalls likely apply to you, because `tsc --declaration{:ts}`
transforms `.ts{:ts}` files into `.d.ts{:ts}` files. If this affects you, then do read about the
[`const{:ts}` enum pitfalls from TypeScript's documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html#const-enum-pitfalls).

## In modern TypeScript, you may not need an enum when an object with `as const` could suffice.

```ts
const enum EDirection {
  Up,
  Down,
  Left,
  Right,
}

const ODirection = {
  Up: 0,
  Down: 1,
  Left: 2,
  Right: 3,
} as const;

// (enum member) EDirection.Up = 0
EDirection.Up;

// (property) Up: 0
ODirection.Up;

// Using the enum as a parameter
function walk(dir: EDirection) {}

// It requires an extra line to pull out the values
type Direction = (typeof ODirection)[keyof typeof ODirection];
function run(dir: Direction) {}

walk(EDirection.Left);
run(ODirection.Right);
```

The biggest argument in favour of this format over TypeScript's `enum` is that it keeps your codebase aligned with the
state of JavaScript, and [when/if](https://github.com/rbuckton/proposal-enum) enums are added to JavaScript then you can
move to the additional syntax.

## In TypeScript, `Iterable{:ts}` is a type we can use if we want to take in types which are iterable.

An object is deemed iterable if it has an implementation for the `Symbol.iterator{:ts}` property. Some built-in types
like `Array{:ts}`, `Map{:ts}`, `Set{:ts}`, `String{:ts}`, `Int32Array{:ts}`, `Uint32Array{:ts}`, etc. have their
`Symbol.iterator{:ts}` property already implemented. `Symbol.iterator{:ts}` function on an object is responsible for
returning the list of values to iterate on.

Here is an example:

```ts
function toArray<X>(xs: Iterable<X>): X[] {
  return [...xs];
}
```

`for..of{:ts}` loops over an iterable object, invoking the `Symbol.iterator{:ts}` property on the object. Here is a
simple `for..of{:ts}` loop on an array:

```ts
let someArray = [1, "string", false];

for (let entry of someArray) {
  console.log(entry);
}
// [!not-code] 1
// [!not-code] string
// [!not-code] false
```

Both `for..of{:ts}` and `for..in{:ts}` statements iterate over lists; the values iterated on are different though,
`for..in{:ts}` returns a list of keys on the object being iterated, whereas `for..of{:ts}` returns a list of values of
the numeric properties of the object being iterated:

```ts
let list = ["a", "b", "c"];

for (let i in list) {
  console.log(i);
}
// [!not-code] 0
// [!not-code] 1
// [!not-code] 2

for (let i of list) {
  console.log(i);
}
// [!not-code] a
// [!not-code] b
// [!not-code] c
```

Another distinction is that `for..in{:ts}` operates on any object; it serves as a way to inspect properties on this
object. `for..of{:ts}` on the other hand, is mainly interested in values of iterable objects. Built-in objects like
`Map{:ts}` and `Set{:ts}` implement `Symbol.iterator{:ts}` property allowing access to stored values:

```ts
let pets: any = new Set(["Cat", "Dog", "Hamster"]);

pets["species"] = "mammals";

for (let pet in pets) {
  console.log(pet);
}
// [!not-code] species

for (let pet of pets) {
  console.log(pet);
}
// [!not-code] Cat
// [!not-code] Dog
// [!not-code] Hamster

console.log(pets);
// [!not-code] Set(3) { 'Cat', 'Dog', 'Hamster', species: 'mammals' }
```

## In TypeScript, when targeting an ES5 or ES3-compliant engine, iterators are only allowed on values of `Array{:ts}` type.

It is an error to use `for..of{:ts}` loops on non-Array values, even if these non-Array values implement the
`Symbol.iterator{:ts}` property.

The compiler will generate a simple `for{:ts}` loop for a `for..of{:ts}` loop, for instance:

```ts
let numbers = [1, 2, 3];

for (let num of numbers) {
  console.log(num);
}
// [!not-code] 1
// [!not-code] 2
// [!not-code] 3
```

will be generated as:

```ts
"use strict";
let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
for (let num of numbers) {
  console.log(num);
}
```

When targeting an ECMAScript 2015-compliant engine, the compiler will generate `for..of{:ts}` loops to target the
built-in iterator implementation in the engine.

## TypeScript provides a special type `unique symbol{:ts}` to enable treating symbols as unique literals.

`unique symbol{:ts}` is a subtype of `symbol{:ts}`, and is produced only from calling `Symbol(){:ts}` or
`Symbol.for(){:ts}`, or from explicit type annotations. This type is only allowed on `const{:ts}` declarations and
`readonly static{:ts}` properties, and to reference a specific unique symbol, you'll have to use the `typeof{:ts}`
operator. Each reference to a unique symbol implies a unique identity that's tied to a given declaration:

```ts
declare const sym1: unique symbol;

// sym2 can only be a constant reference.
// [!code error:3]
let sym2: unique symbol = Symbol();
// [!not-code] A variable whose type is a 'unique symbol' type must be 'const'.

// Works - refers to a unique symbol, but its identity is tied to 'sym1'.
let sym3: typeof sym1 = sym1;

// Also works.
class C {
  static readonly StaticSymbol: unique symbol = Symbol();
}
```

Because each `unique symbol{:ts}` has a completely separate identity, no two `unique symbol{:ts}` types are assignable
or comparable to each other:

```ts
const sym2 = Symbol();

const sym3 = Symbol();

// [!code error:3]
if (sym2 === sym3) {
  // [!not-code] This comparison appears to be unintentional because the types 'typeof sym2' and 'typeof sym3' have no overlap.
  // ...
}
```

## In TypeScript, you can use triple-slash directives at the top of your containing file to specify compiler directives.

Triple-slash directives are single-line comments containing a single XML tag. The contents of the comment are used as
compiler directives.

Triple-slash directives are only valid at the top of their containing file. A triple-slash directive can only be
preceded by single or multi-line comments, including other triple-slash directives. If they are encountered following a
statement or a declaration they are treated as regular single-line comments and hold no special meaning. You can learn
more about [triple-slash directives from the TypeScript docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/triple-slash-directives.html).

## Conclusion

Remember, **"hackers hack, crackers crack, and whiners whine. Be a hacker."** Take care.
