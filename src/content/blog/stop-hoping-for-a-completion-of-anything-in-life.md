I just read these from the book **"The Way of the Superior Man"** on the morning
of the 2nd day of July, and I thought it was worth sharing:

> Most men make the error of thinking that one day it will be done. They think,
> "If I can work enough, then one day I could rest." Or, "One day my woman will
> understand something and then she will stop complaining." Or, "I'm only doing
> this now so that one day I can do what I really want with my life." The
> masculine error is to think that eventually things will be different in some
> fundamental way. They won't. It never ends. As long as life continues, the
> creative challenge is to tussle, play, and make love with the present moment
> while giving your unique gift.

Indeed as David Deia goes on to explain further:

> It's never going to be over, so stop waiting for the good stuff. As of now,
> spend a minimum of one hour a day doing whatever you are waiting to do until
> your finances are more secure, or until the children have grown and left home,
> or until you have finished your obligations and you feel free to do what you
> really want to do. Don’t wait any longer. Don't believe in the myth of "one
> day when everything will be different." Do what you love to do, what you are
> waiting to do, what you’ve been born to do, now.

Thank you David Deia. I needed these rich words at this time of my life.
Hopefully, I practice this, spending **TWO**, not just **ONE** hour a day.
