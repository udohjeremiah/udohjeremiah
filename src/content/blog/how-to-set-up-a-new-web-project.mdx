## Introduction

Creating a new web project—whether for learning, a hobby, freelance work, or a company—is a task you would often
undertake as a developer. Not having a definitive system or guide to follow, can make this process inefficient and
inconsistent. While a CLI (command line interface) that automatically scaffolds a project can be helpful, each project's
needs are unique, and relying solely on such tools may not always be the best approach. Understanding the processes
involved in starting a project from scratch is valuable, as it would provide you with foundational knowledge that can be
useful when creating a customized approach tailored to your project's specific needs.

This article provides a step-by-step guide on initiating and configuring a new web project from scratch using the
[Remix web framework](https://remix.run). While you might often use the CLI provided by a library or framework for
initialization, this guide goes beyond that. It covers customizing your project setup to meet specific requirements,
integrating various tools and practices for a streamlined development process, and applying best practices for version
control, dependency management, and continuous integration.

## Prerequisite

This article assumes you have a basic understanding of building websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and are
familiar with working in the terminal (or "command line"). If not, I recommend familiarizing yourself with these
technologies before proceeding.

## Version control

Version control is a system that manages changes to a project's files over time. A major feature of version control is
that it ensures any changes made to your project are **trackable** and **reversible**. As a solo developer, you may not
see the need for version control when you're not collaborating with other developers or your project isn't open-source.
But, the ability to track the changes you've made over time and reverse those changes to a previous version when
needed makes it a worthwhile decision for every developer. [Git](https://git-scm.com) is a popular version control
system, and [GitHub](https://github.com) is a popular platform for hosting and managing Git repositories. Together, they
make version control easy for developers.

### Step 1: Create an empty Git repository

To create a Git repository, you need to have Git installed on your system. Run the following command in your terminal to
check if Git is installed:

```bash
git -v
```

If the output indicates that `git{:bash}` is an unknown command, refer to this
[GitHub article on how to install Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git). Otherwise, run the following commands
to create a new directory, replacing `setup-web-project{:.constant.language.undefined}` with your project's name, and
initialize it as a Git repository:

```bash
mkdir setup-web-project
cd setup-web-project
git init
```

Now, make your first commit:

```bash
echo "# setup-web-project" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "First commit"
```

Your `setup-web-project{:.constant.language.undefined}` directory structure should now look like this:

```
.
└── README.md
```

### Step 2: Create a GitHub repository and connect it to your local repository

To create a repository on GitHub, you need a GitHub account. [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) if you
don't have one yet. Now, create a new GitHub repository named `setup-web-project{:.constant.language.undefined}`. Refer
to this
[GitHub article on creating a new repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository)
if you need help.

After creating your new repository, your GitHub repository page should show a quick setup screen:

![Repository quick setup screen](/blog/how-to-set-up-a-new-web-project/image-1.webp)

Copy and run the command under **...or push an existing repository from the command line**. The code should look like
this, replacing `udohjeremiah{:.constant.language.undefined}` with your GitHub username:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/udohjeremiah/setup-web-project.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

After running the commands successfully, refresh the page of your repository on GitHub. The screen should now display
the contents of your repository:

![Repository home page](/blog/how-to-set-up-a-new-web-project/image-2.webp)

## JavaScript runtime and package manager

A JavaScript runtime is an environment that allows JavaScript to be executed outside the browser, providing the
necessary tools and APIs. The most well-known JavaScript runtime is [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). A package manager
automates installing, updating, configuring, and managing software packages. [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) is the default
package manager for Node.js applications. With Node.js, developers can use JavaScript outside the browser, and npm
enables them to publish their packages or install packages created by others from the npm registry, facilitating code
reuse and sharing within the developer community.

### Step 3: Initialize your Git repository as a new npm package

To initialize an npm package, you need to have Node.js and the npm CLI installed on your system. Run the following
commands in your terminal to check if Node.js and the npm CLI are installed:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

If the output indicates that `node{:bash}` or `npm{:bash}` is an unknown
command, refer to this
[npm article on installing Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).
Otherwise, run the following command to initialize your Git repository as a new npm package:

```bash
npm init -y
```

After running the command successfully, a new file named `package.json{:.constant.language.undefined}` will be created
in your `setup-web-project{:.constant.language.undefined}` directory. The default content of the file will look like
this:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "name": "setup-web-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}

```

The `npm init -y{:bash}` command initializes a new npm package by creating a
`package.json{:.constant.language.undefined}` file with default values. Since this is a web project rather than a
typical npm package for others to install, you should edit the `package.json{:.constant.language.undefined}` file as
follows:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "name": "setup-web-project",
  "private": true,
  "sideEffects": false,
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {},
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=20.0.0"
  }
}

```

Your `setup-web-project{:.constant.language.undefined}` directory structure should now look like this:

```
.
├── README.md
└── package.json
```

Finally, stage, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the following commands:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Initialize npm package"
git push origin
```

## Dependencies and development dependencies in npm

Dependencies are packages that a project needs to run in production. These are essential for the project to function
properly when it's deployed. They are installed with the command `npm install <package-name>{:bash}` and listed under
the `"dependencies"{:json}` section in the `package.json{:.constant.language.undefined}` file. Development dependencies
are packages only needed during the development phase, as they are not required for the application to run in
production. They are installed with the command `npm install -D <package-name>{:bash}` and listed under the
`"devDependencies"{:json}` section in the `package.json{:.constant.language.undefined}` file.

### Step 4: Install the runtime dependencies for a Remix app

Run the following command to install the dependencies for a Remix app:

```bash
npm install @remix-run/node @remix-run/react @remix-run/serve isbot@4 react react-dom
```

Did you notice that your `setup-web-project{:.constant.language.undefined}` directory now contains a
`package-lock.json{:.constant.language.undefined}` file and a `node_modules{:.constant.language.undefined}` directory
you did not create? The `package-lock.json{:.constant.language.undefined}` file is automatically generated to lock the
versions of installed packages, ensuring consistent installs. The `node_modules{:.constant.language.undefined}`
directory, also automatically added by npm, contains all project dependencies and can become very large. Therefore, it
is unnecessary to include it in the GitHub repository. Dependencies can be reinstalled using the project's
`package.json{:.constant.language.undefined}` file with `npm install{:bash}`.

To prevent a file or directory from being tracked by Git and pushed to GitHub from your local repository, you can ignore
it by adding it to a `.gitignore{:.constant.language.undefined}` file. Run the following command to create a
`.gitignore{:.constant.language.undefined}` file and ignore the `node_modules{:.constant.language.undefined}` directory:

```bash
echo "node_modules" >> .gitignore
```

Your `setup-web-project{:.constant.language.undefined}` directory structure should now look like this:

```
.
├── README.md
├── .gitignore
├── node_modules
│   └── ... (contains more directories and files)
├── package-lock.json
└── package.json
```

Finally, stage, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the following commands:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Install runtime dependencies"
git push origin
```

### Step 5: Install and set up the build tools for a Remix app

Run the following command to install the build tools for a Remix app:

```bash
npm install -D @remix-run/dev vite
```

Since Remix uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) to compile your application, providing a
[Vite config](https://vitejs.dev/config) file with the Remix Vite plugin from `@remix-run/dev{:ts}` is necessary.

Run the following command to create a `vite.config.ts{:.constant.language.undefined}` file:

```bash
touch vite.config.ts
```

Copy the following code into the `vite.config.ts{:.constant.language.undefined}` file:

```ts title="vite.config.ts"
import { vitePlugin as remix } from "@remix-run/dev";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [remix()]
});
```

Add the following scripts to the `"scripts"{:json}` property in the `package.json{:.constant.language.undefined}` file:

```json title="package.json"
{
  // ...existing configurations
  "scripts": {
    "build": "remix vite:build", // [!code ++]
    "dev": "remix vite:dev", // [!code ++]
    "start": "remix-serve ./build/server/index.js" // [!code ++]
  }
  // ...existing configurations
}

```

- `npm run dev{:bash}`: is used to start the development server.
- `npm run build{:bash}`: is used to build the app for production.
- `npm run start{:bash}`: is used to start a production server.

Update your `.gitignore{:.constant.language.undefined}` file to ignore the `build{:.constant.language.undefined}`
directory created whenever you run the command `npm run build{:bash}`. This directory contains the highly optimized
production build for deployment and should not be included in your GitHub repository:

```.gitignore title=".gitignore"
node_modules

/build // [!code ++]

```

Your `setup-web-project{:.constant.language.undefined}` directory structure should now look like this:

```
.
├── README.md
├── .gitignore
├── node_modules
│   └── ... (contains more directories and files)
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
└── vite.config.ts
```

Finally, stage, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the following commands:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Install and setup build tools"
git push origin
```

### Step 6: Install and set up TypeScript for type safety

Run the following command to install [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org):

```bash
npm install -D typescript
```

Run the following command to create a `tsconfig.json{:.constant.language.undefined}` file to indicate that
`setup-web-project{:.constant.language.undefined}` is the root of a TypeScript project:

```bash
touch tsconfig.json
```

Copy the code from
[Remix's `tsconfig.json` template](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/blob/main/templates/remix/tsconfig.json) to the
`tsconfig.json{:.constant.language.undefined}` file to specify the files to be included in the compilation and the
compiler options required to compile the project:

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "include": [
    "**/*.ts",
    "**/*.tsx",
    "**/.server/**/*.ts",
    "**/.server/**/*.tsx",
    "**/.client/**/*.ts",
    "**/.client/**/*.tsx"
  ],
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": ["DOM", "DOM.Iterable", "ES2022"],
    "types": ["@remix-run/node", "vite/client"],
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "Bundler",
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "target": "ES2022",
    "strict": true,
    "allowJs": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "~/*": ["./app/*"]
    },

    // Vite takes care of building everything, not tsc.
    "noEmit": true
  }
}
```

Install the type definitions for `react{:ts}` and `react-dom{:ts}`:

```bash
npm install -D @types/react @types/react-dom
```

Install the `vite-tsconfig-paths{:.constant.language.undefined}` package to give Vite the ability to resolve imports
using TypeScript's path mapping:

```bash
npm install -D vite-tsconfig-paths
```

Update your `vite.config.ts{:.constant.language.undefined}` file to add the `vite-tsconfig-paths{:ts}` plugin:

```ts title="vite.config.ts"
import { vitePlugin as remix } from "@remix-run/dev";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import tsconfigPaths from "vite-tsconfig-paths"; // [!code ++]

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [remix(), tsconfigPaths()] // [!code ++]
});
```

Add the `typecheck{:json}` script to the `"scripts"{:json}` property in the
`package.json{:.constant.language.undefined}` file:

```json title="package.json"
{
  // ...existing configurations
  "scripts": {
    "build": "remix vite:build",
    "dev": "remix vite:dev",
    "start": "remix-serve ./build/server/index.js",
    "typecheck": "bash -c \"tsc $* --noEmit\"" // [!code ++]
  }
  // ...existing configurations
}

```

- `npm run typecheck{:bash}`: is used to check the type safety of the program, ensuring it's free of type-related
  errors.

Your `setup-web-project{:.constant.language.undefined}` directory structure should now look like this:

```
.
├── README.md
├── .gitignore
├── node_modules
│   └── ... (contains more directories and files)
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── vite.config.ts
```

Finally, stage, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the following commands:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Install and set up typescript for type safety"
git push origin
```

### Step 7: Install and set up Tailwind CSS for styling

Run the following command to install [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and its peer dependencies:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

Run the following command to generate `tailwind.config.ts{:.constant.language.undefined}` and
`postcss.config.js{:.constant.language.undefined}` files:

```bash
npx tailwindcss init --ts -p
```

Copy the code from
[Remix's `tailwind.config.ts` template](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/blob/main/templates/remix/tailwind.config.ts)
into the `tailwind.config.ts{:.constant.language.undefined}` file to add the paths to all of your template files:

```ts title="tailwind.config.ts"
import type { Config } from "tailwindcss";

export default {
  content: ["./app/**/{**,.client,.server}/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
} satisfies Config;
```

Your `setup-web-project{:.constant.language.undefined}` directory should now look like this:

```
.
├── README.md
├── .gitignore
├── node_modules
│   └── ... (contains more directories and files)
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── postcss.config.js
├── tailwind.config.ts
├── tsconfig.json
└── vite.config.ts
```

Finally, stage, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the following commands:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Install and set up tailwindcss for styling"
git push origin
```

### Step 8: Create the root and index routes

In Remix, `app/root.tsx{:.constant.language.undefined}` is the root layout of your entire app and is called the
"Root Route." It is the first component in the UI that renders, so it typically contains the global layout for the page.

Run the following commands to create the Root Route:

```bash
mkdir app
touch app/root.tsx
```

You need a `tailwind.css{:.constant.language.undefined}` file inside the `app{:.constant.language.undefined}` directory.
This file will include the `@tailwind{:css}` directives for each of Tailwind's layers.

Run the following command to create a `tailwind.css{:.constant.language.undefined}` file inside
`app{:.constant.language.undefined}`:

```bash
touch app/tailwind.css
```

Copy the following code into the `app/tailwind.css{:.constant.language.undefined}` file:

```css title="app/tailwind.css"
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Copy the following code into the `app/root.tsx{:.constant.language.undefined}` file so that all other routes will render
inside the `<Outlet />{:tsx}`:

```tsx title="app/root.tsx"
import {
  Links,
  Meta,
  Outlet,
  Scripts,
  ScrollRestoration,
} from "@remix-run/react";

import "./tailwind.css";

export default function Root() {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charSet="utf-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
        <Links />
        <Meta />
      </head>
      <body>
        <Outlet />
        <ScrollRestoration />
        <Scripts />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

In Remix, any JavaScript or TypeScript files in the `app/routes{:.constant.language.undefined}` directory will become
routes in your app. The filename maps to the route's URL pathname (`app/routes/about.tsx{:.constant.language.undefined}`
matches the route `/about{:.constant.language.undefined}`, `app/routes/contact.tsx{:.constant.language.undefined}`
matches the route `/contact{:.constant.language.undefined}`), except for `_index.tsx{:.constant.language.undefined}`,
which serves as the **index route** for the root route, matching the route `/{:.constant.language.undefined}`.

Run the following commands to create the index route for the root route:

```bash
mkdir app/routes
touch app/routes/_index.tsx
```

Copy the following code into the `app/routes/_index.tsx{:.constant.language.undefined}` file:

```tsx title="app/routes/_index.tsx"
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className="flex h-screen w-screen items-center justify-center px-5 py-24">
      <div className="absolute inset-0 -z-10 h-full w-full items-center px-5 py-24 [background:radial-gradient(125%_125%_at_50%_10%,#000_40%,#63e_100%)]"></div>

      <div className="flex max-w-2xl flex-col items-center space-y-6">
        <div className="flex">
          <span className="relative overflow-hidden rounded-full p-[1px]">
            <span className="absolute inset-[-1000%] animate-[spin_2s_linear_infinite] bg-[conic-gradient(from_90deg_at_50%_50%,#171717_0%,#737373_50%,#171717_100%)]" />
            <div className="select-none rounded-full bg-black px-3 py-1 text-xs font-medium leading-5 text-slate-200 backdrop-blur-xl">
              I'm almost there
            </div>
          </span>
        </div>

        <h2 className="text-center text-3xl font-medium text-gray-50 sm:text-6xl">
          New project loading...
        </h2>

        <p className="text-center text-lg leading-6 text-gray-200">
          Setting up and customizing my new web project, integrating tools, and applying best practices for a smooth development process. Stay tuned for more updates!
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now, run the following command to start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/) in your browser, and you should see a screen that looks like this:

![Localhost](/blog/how-to-set-up-a-new-web-project/image-3.webp)

Your `setup-web-project{:.constant.language.undefined}` directory structure should now look like this:

```
.
├── README.md
├── .gitignore
├── app
│   ├── root.tsx
│   ├── routes
│   │   └── _index.tsx
│   └── tailwind.css
├── node_modules
│   └── ... (contains more directories and files)
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── postcss.config.js
├── tailwind.config.ts
├── tsconfig.json
└── vite.config.ts
```

Finally, stage, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the following commands:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Create the root and index routes"
git push origin
```

### Step 9: Install and set up ESLint for linting

Linting is analyzing code to catch potential errors and enforce coding standards. [ESLint](https://eslint.org) is the
most popular linting tool for JavaScript, offering customizable rules for maintaining code quality and consistency.

Run the following command to install ESLint and React-specific plugins for ESLint:

```bash
npm install -D eslint eslint-plugin-import eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y eslint-plugin-react eslint-plugin-react-hooks
```

Run the following command to install TypeScript-specific plugins:

```bash
npm install -D eslint-import-resolver-typescript @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin @typescript-eslint/parser
```

Run the following command to create a `.eslintrc.cjs{:.constant.language.undefined}` file for your ESLint configuration:

```bash
touch .eslintrc.cjs
```

Copy the code from
[Remix's `.eslintrc.cjs` template](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/blob/main/templates/remix/.eslintrc.cjs) into the
`eslintrc.cjs{:.constant.language.undefined}` file:

```js
/**
 * This is intended to be a basic starting point for linting in your app.
 * It relies on recommended configs out of the box for simplicity, but you can
 * and should modify this configuration to best suit your team's needs.
 */

/** @type {import('eslint').Linter.Config} */
module.exports = {
  root: true,
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: "latest",
    sourceType: "module",
    ecmaFeatures: {
      jsx: true,
    },
  },
  env: {
    browser: true,
    commonjs: true,
    es6: true,
  },
  ignorePatterns: ["!**/.server", "!**/.client"],

  // Base config
  extends: ["eslint:recommended"],

  overrides: [
    // React
    {
      files: ["**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
      plugins: ["react", "jsx-a11y"],
      extends: [
        "plugin:react/recommended",
        "plugin:react/jsx-runtime",
        "plugin:react-hooks/recommended",
        "plugin:jsx-a11y/recommended",
      ],
      settings: {
        react: {
          version: "detect",
        },
        formComponents: ["Form"],
        linkComponents: [
          { name: "Link", linkAttribute: "to" },
          { name: "NavLink", linkAttribute: "to" },
        ],
        "import/resolver": {
          typescript: {},
        },
      },
    },

    // Typescript
    {
      files: ["**/*.{ts,tsx}"],
      plugins: ["@typescript-eslint", "import"],
      parser: "@typescript-eslint/parser",
      settings: {
        "import/internal-regex": "^~/",
        "import/resolver": {
          node: {
            extensions: [".ts", ".tsx"],
          },
          typescript: {
            alwaysTryTypes: true,
          },
        },
      },
      extends: [
        "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended",
        "plugin:import/recommended",
        "plugin:import/typescript",
      ],
    },

    // Node
    {
      files: [".eslintrc.cjs"],
      env: {
        node: true,
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

Add the following scripts to the `"scripts"{:json}` property in the `package.json{:.constant.language.undefined}` file:

```json title="package.json"
{
  // ...existing configurations
  "scripts": {
    "build": "remix vite:build",
    "dev": "remix vite:dev",
    "lint": "eslint --ignore-path .gitignore --cache --cache-location ./node_modules/.cache/eslint .", // [!code ++]
    "lint:fix": "eslint --fix --ignore-path .gitignore --cache --cache-location ./node_modules/.cache/eslint .", // [!code ++]
    "start": "remix-serve ./build/server/index.js",
    "typecheck": "bash -c \"tsc $* --noEmit\""
  }
  // ...existing configurations
}

```

- `npm run lint{:bash}`: is used to check the program for linting errors, ensuring it adheres to ESLint's style.
- `npm run lint:fix{:bash}`: is used to automatically fix linting errors in the program that ESLint can resolve.

Your `setup-web-project{:.constant.language.undefined}` directory structure should now look like this:

```
.
├── README.md
├── .eslintrc.cjs
├── .gitignore
├── app
│   ├── root.tsx
│   ├── routes
│   │   └── _index.tsx
│   └── tailwind.css
├── node_modules
│   └── ... (contains more directories and files)
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── postcss.config.js
├── tailwind.config.ts
├── tsconfig.json
└── vite.config.ts
```

Finally, stage, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the following commands:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Install and setup eslint for linting"
git push origin
```

### Step 10: Install and set up Prettier for code formatting

Code formatting involves organizing code consistently according to predefined style rules, improving readability and
maintainability. [Prettier](https://prettier.io) is the most popular code formatting tool for JavaScript. It
automatically formats code to ensure a consistent style across projects.

Run the following command to install Prettier:

```bash
npm install -D prettier
```

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It applies a default set of rules to your code regardless of any
configuration. But, it does not handle code sorting out of the box. To enable this feature, you need to use a
plugin.

Run the following command to install the
[Tailwind CSS plugin](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss#readme) that sorts its utility classes
and [Trivago's plugin](https://github.com/trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports#readme) that sorts import declarations:

```bash
npm install -D prettier-plugin-tailwindcss @trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports
```

Run the following command to create a `prettier.config.js{:.constant.language.undefined}` file for your Prettier
configuration:

```bash
touch prettier.config.js
```

Copy the following code into the `prettier.config.js{:.constant.language.undefined}` file:

```json title="prettier.config.js"
/** @type {import('prettier').Options} */
export default {
  "importOrder": [
    "^~/components/(.*)$",
    "^~/hooks/(.*)$",
    "^~/lib/(.*)$",
    "^~/routes/(.*)$",
    "^~/styles/(.*)$",
    "^~/utils/(.*)$",
    "^[./]"
  ],
  "importOrderSeparation": true,
  "importOrderSortSpecifiers": true,

  "plugins": [
    "@trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports",
    "prettier-plugin-tailwindcss"
  ]
};
```

Add the following scripts to the `"scripts"{:json}` property in the `package.json{:.constant.language.undefined}` file:

```json title="package.json"
{
  // ...existing configurations
  "scripts": {
    "build": "remix vite:build",
    "dev": "remix vite:dev",
    "format": "prettier --check --ignore-path .gitignore .", // [!code ++]
    "format:fix": "prettier --write --ignore-path .gitignore .", // [!code ++]
    "lint": "eslint --ignore-path .gitignore --cache --cache-location ./node_modules/.cache/eslint .",
    "lint:fix": "eslint --fix --ignore-path .gitignore --cache --cache-location ./node_modules/.cache/eslint .",
    "start": "remix-serve ./build/server/index.js",
    "typecheck": "bash -c \"tsc $* --noEmit\""
  }
  // ...existing configurations
}

```

- `npm run format{:bash}`: is used to check the code format of the program, ensuring it adheres to Prettier's style.
- `npm run format:fix{:bash}`: is used to automatically fix code formatting errors in the program.

Your `setup-web-project{:.constant.language.undefined}` directory structure should now look like this:

```
.
├── README.md
├── .eslintrc.cjs
├── .gitignore
├── app
│   ├── root.tsx
│   ├── routes
│   │   └── _index.tsx
│   └── tailwind.css
├── node_modules
│   └── ... (contains more directories and files)
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── postcss.config.js
├── prettier.config.js
├── tailwind.config.ts
├── tsconfig.json
└── vite.config.ts
```

Finally, stage, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the following commands:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Install and setup prettier for code formatting"
git push origin
```

### Step 11: Install and set up git hooks

Git hooks are scripts that Git executes automatically before or after a particular event
(such as commit, push, merge, etc) occurs in a Git repository. They are used to automate tasks, enforce policies, ensure
consistency, etc. In the JavaScript ecosystem, [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#github) is a popular tool that
makes managing Git hooks easy, and [lint-staged](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged#readme) is a popular tool
used to run linters on files staged for commit. Together, husky and lint-staged can be used to automate tasks that run
before the commit process.

Run the following command to install husky and lint-staged:

```bash
npm i -D husky lint-staged
```

Update the `package.json{:.constant.language.undefined}` file to include the `"lint-staged"{:json}` configuration as
follows:

```json title="package.json"
{
  // ...existing configurations
  "lint-staged": { // [!code ++]
    "*": "npm run format", // [!code ++]
    "*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}": [ // [!code ++]
      "npm run lint", // [!code ++]
      "npm run typecheck" // [!code ++]
    ], // [!code ++]
    "*.{html,css,js,ts,md,jsx,tsx,mdx}": "npm run build ." // [!code ++]
  } // [!code ++]
}

```

Now, run the following command to set up husky in the project:

```bash
npx husky init
```

After running the command successfully, a `.husky{:.constant.language.undefined}` directory with a
`pre-commit{:.constant.language.undefined}` file will be created, and the `prepare{:json}` script will be added to the
`"scripts"{:json}` property in the `package.json{:.constant.language.undefined}` file:

```json title="package.json"
{
  // ...existing configurations
  "scripts": {
    "build": "remix vite:build",
    "dev": "remix vite:dev",
    "format": "prettier --check --ignore-path .gitignore .",
    "format:fix": "prettier --write --ignore-path .gitignore .",
    "lint": "eslint --ignore-path .gitignore --cache --cache-location ./node_modules/.cache/eslint .",
    "lint:fix": "eslint --fix --ignore-path .gitignore --cache --cache-location ./node_modules/.cache/eslint .",
    "start": "remix-serve ./build/server/index.js",
    "typecheck": "bash -c \"tsc $* --noEmit\"",
    "prepare": "husky" // [!code ++]
  }
  // ...existing configurations
}

```

Update the `.husky/pre-commit{:.constant.language.undefined}` file to:

```.husky/pre-commit
npx lint-staged
```

Your `setup-web-project{:.constant.language.undefined}` directory structure should now look like this:

```
.
├── README.md
├── .eslintrc.cjs
├── .gitignore
├── .husky
│   ├── _
│   │   └── ... (contains more directories and files)
│   └── pre-commit
├── app
│   ├── root.tsx
│   ├── routes
│   │   └── _index.tsx
│   └── tailwind.css
├── node_modules
│   └── ... (contains more directories and files)
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── postcss.config.js
├── prettier.config.js
├── tailwind.config.ts
├── tsconfig.json
└── vite.config.ts
```

Now, stage and commit your changes with the following commands:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Install and setup git hooks for pre-commit checks"
```

Oops 😬, we encountered an error. I apologize for the inconvenience. You just saw the power of Git hooks in action.
Currently, our codebase does not adhere to Prettier's style. Although we have set up Prettier, we have not yet formatted
the codebase. So, when attempting to commit our changes, the pre-commit Git hook is automatically triggered before the
commit process. The specified tests in the Git hook failed, leading to the interruption of the commit process:

![Terminal error screen](/blog/how-to-set-up-a-new-web-project/image-4.webp)

As indicated in the error message (see photo above), we can use the `--write{:bash}` flag with Prettier to fix the code
style issues automatically. We've already configured a script for this in our
`package.json{:.constant.language.undefined}`.

Run the following command to format the codebase to adhere to Prettier's style:

```bash
npm run format:fix
```

After successfully running the command, Prettier will format our files, making changes to the ones we staged last time.
Therefore, we should stage the modifications and attempt to commit again:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Install and setup git hooks for pre-commit checks"
```

Once again 😩! The commit process is interrupted but for good reasons. This time it's not Prettier, but ESLint that
found a problem with our code:

![Terminal error screen](/blog/how-to-set-up-a-new-web-project/image-5.webp)

Again, the error message tells us how to fix the issues. Go into the
`app/routes/_index.tsx{:.constant.language.undefined}` file and change all occurrences of `'{:tsx}` with `&apos;{:tsx}`.
Also remember, to run `npm run format:fix{:bash}` after making these changes, to make sure the codebase adheres to
Prettier's style.

Run the following commands to stage the changes and attempt to commit again:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Install and setup git hooks for pre-commit checks"
```

Hurray! 🎉 It worked. With that done, run the following command to push your changes to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin
```

## Continuous integration and dependency management

Continuous integration (CI) is a software development practice where developers frequently commit code changes to a
central repository. Each commit is automatically checked to ensure it is fit for production by building the project and
running tests to catch errors quickly. Dependency management involves handling the packages that your project depends
on. It includes tasks such as installing, updating, and resolving dependencies to ensure your project has all the
necessary components to function correctly. GitHub provides built-in CI and dependency management capabilities through
[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) and
[Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/about-dependabot-alerts).

### Step 12: Setup CI and dependency management with GitHub

For GitHub to discover any GitHub Actions workflows in your repository, you must save the workflow files in a directory
called `.github/workflows{:.constant.language.undefined}`. You can name the workflow file anything, but it must have a
`.yml{:.constant.language.undefined}` or `.yaml{:.constant.language.undefined}` extension.

Run the following commands to create the `.github/workflows{:.constant.language.undefined}` directory:

```bash
mkdir .github
mkdir .github/workflows
```

Previously, you added a pre-commit Git hook to your repository to ensure that your code is correctly formatted, free of
linting or type-related errors and that the build process completes successfully before committing any staged files.
Additionally, you can ensure these tests run whenever a pull request is opened or code is pushed to the
`main{:.constant.language.undefined}` branch on your hosted GitHub repository using CI. GitHub will run the CI tests and
provide the results in the pull request, so you can see whether the changes in your branch introduce any errors. When
all CI tests in a workflow pass, the changes you pushed are ready to be merged. If a test fails, one of your changes may
have caused the failure.

Run the following command to create a `ci.yml{:.constant.language.undefined}` file in the
`.github/workflows{:.constant.language.undefined}` directory:

```bash
touch .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

Copy the following code into the `.github/workflows/ci.yml{:.constant.language.undefined}` file:

```yaml title=".github/workflows/ci.yml"
# The name of the workflow
name: CI

# Events that will cause the workflow to run
on:
  # When a pull request is opened or reopened or when the head branch of the pull request is updated
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
  # When you push a commit or tag, or when you create a repository from a template
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  # When a workflow is triggered manually, using the GitHub API, GitHub CLI, or GitHub browser interface
  workflow_dispatch:

# Ensure only one workflow runs at a time for each pull request or push to the main branch
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs, which run in parallel by default
jobs:
  build: # The unique identifier for the job
    name: Build # The name for the job, which is displayed in the GitHub UI
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }} # The type of machine to run the job on
    strategy: # Defines a matrix of different job configurations
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest]
        node_version: ["20.x"]
    # A job contains a sequence of tasks called steps
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Node.js and cache dependencies
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
          cache: "npm"
          cache-dependency-path: "**/package-lock.json"

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Check code format with Prettier
        run: npm run format

      - name: Check code for linting errors with ESLint
        run: npm run lint

      - name: Type check with TypeScript
        run: npm run typecheck

      - name: Build with Vite
        run: npm run build

```

Dependabot creates pull requests to keep your dependencies secure and up-to-date. To configure Dependabot to maintain
your repository, you need a Dependabot configuration file, `dependabot.yml{:.constant.language.undefined}`, stored in
the `.github{:.constant.language.undefined}` directory.

Run the following command to create the `.github/dependabot.yml{:.constant.language.undefined}` file:

```bash
touch .github/dependabot.yml
```

Copy the following code into the `.github/dependabot.yml{:.constant.language.undefined}` file:

```yaml title=".github/dependabot.yml"
version: 2

updates:
  # Enable version updates for github-actions
  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
    # Look for workflow files in the `.github/workflows` directory
    directory: "/"
    # Check for updates to GitHub Actions every week
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    commit-message:
      # Prefix all commit messages with "github-actions: "
      prefix: "github-actions"

  # Enable version updates for npm
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    # Look for `package.json` and lock files in the root directory
    directory: "/"
    # Check the npm registry for updates once a month
    schedule:
      interval: "monthly"
    # Include a list of updated dependencies
    # with a prefix determined by the dependency group
    commit-message:
      prefix: "npm"
      prefix-development: "npm dev"
      include: "scope"
    # Allow up to 10 open pull requests for npm dependencies
    open-pull-requests-limit: 10

```

Your `setup-web-project{:.constant.language.undefined}` directory structure should now look like this:

```
.
├── README.md
├── .eslintrc.cjs
├── .github
│   ├── workflows
│   │   └── ci.yml
│   └── dependabot.yml

```

Finally, stage, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the following commands:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Setup CI and dependency management"
git push origin
```

## Git workflow

A Git workflow is a structured method for managing changes to a project's source code using Git. It defines how changes
are proposed, reviewed, and integrated into the project, ensuring work is done consistently and efficiently. Various Git
workflows exist, each tailored to different types of projects and teams. A popular workflow for continuously deployed
software, such as web applications, is the [GitHub Flow](https://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow/). GitHub Flow
is a simplified workflow that uses only feature branches and the `main{:.constant.language.undefined}` branch. All
changes are merged into the `main{:.constant.language.undefined}` branch via
[pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests), and the `main{:.constant.language.undefined}` branch is
continuously deployed in small, incremental updates as changes are merged into it.

### Step 13: Add a ruleset to the `main{:.constant.language.undefined}` branch

To require a pull request and status checks to pass before merging, follow these steps:

1. Refer to this [GitHub article on creating a branch or tag ruleset](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/creating-rulesets-for-a-repository#creating-a-branch-or-tag-ruleset) for detailed instructions.
2. Complete the steps outlined in the article.

After completing the steps from the "Creating a branch or tag ruleset" section, you should see a screen that looks like
this:

![Github new branch ruleset screen](/blog/how-to-set-up-a-new-web-project/image-6.webp)

3. Under **Ruleset Name**, enter the value "GitHub Flow".
4. Change the **Enforcement status** from "Disabled" to "Active".
5. Under **Target branches**, click on the **Add target** button and select **Include default branch**.
6. Under **Branch rules**, check the following options:

- **Require a pull request before merging**
- **Require status checks to pass**

After clicking on **Require status checks to pass**, an additional settings will be displayed:

![Github new branch ruleset screen](/blog/how-to-set-up-a-new-web-project/image-7.webp)

7. Check the option **Require branches to be up to date before merging**.
8. Click on the **Add checks** button. In the displayed search input, type "Build". You'll see a list of suggestions.
   Click on **Add Build (ubuntu-latest, 20.x)**.
9. Finally, click the **Create** button to save your changes.

## Testing it all

Congratulations 🎉! Your project configuration is complete, and you can now start developing your app. To get started,
create a feature branch from the `main{:.constant.language.undefined}` branch for your specific feature, and push this
new branch to the remote repository. Switch to the feature branch, make your changes, and push them to the remote
repository. Then, open a pull request on the `main{:.constant.language.undefined}` branch to propose your changes. Once
your pull request passes all CI tests, merge your changes into the `main{:.constant.language.undefined}` branch and
delete your feature branch (if it's no longer needed). To see this process in action, let's work on a feature together.

### Create and push a feature branch from the `main{:.constant.language.undefined}` branch

Run the following commands to switch to your `main{:.constant.language.undefined}` branch, pull from the remote tracking
branch to ensure `main{:.constant.language.undefined}` is up-to-date with the latest changes in the remote repository,
and create the `complete-homepage{:.constant.language.undefined}` feature branch from it:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin
git branch complete-homepage
```

The `complete-homepage{:.constant.language.undefined}` branch is now created
(run the command `git branch{:bash}` to see it). But, the remote repository still does not have a copy of it. As a best
practice, even before you start working on a feature, it's important to push this branch to the remote repository so
that it has a copy. This informs other developers (if you're working on a team or your project is open-source) about the
new feature you're working on, potentially avoiding conflicts with other developers unknowingly working on the same
thing.

Run the following command to push the new branch to the remote repository:

```bash
git push origin complete-homepage
```

After running the command successfully, you can check if the feature branch was pushed to the remote repository. To do
this, go to your repository, click on the button displaying **main** with a dropdown icon, and you'll see a list of all
the branches in the repository:

![Repository home page screen](/blog/how-to-set-up-a-new-web-project/image-8.webp)

### Make and push your changes

Run the following command to switch to the `complete-homepage{:.constant.language.undefined}` branch so you can start
working on your feature:

```bash
git checkout complete-homepage
```

Next, update the `app/routes/_index.tsx{:.constant.language.undefined}` file with these changes:

```tsx title="app/routes/_index.tsx"
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className="flex h-screen w-screen items-center justify-center px-5 py-24">
      <div className="absolute inset-0 -z-10 h-full w-full items-center px-5 py-24 [background:radial-gradient(125%_125%_at_50%_10%,#000_40%,#63e_100%)]"></div>

      <div className="flex max-w-2xl flex-col items-center space-y-6">
        <div className="flex">
          <span className="relative overflow-hidden rounded-full p-[1px]">
            <span className="absolute inset-[-1000%] animate-[spin_2s_linear_infinite] bg-[conic-gradient(from_90deg_at_50%_50%,#171717_0%,#737373_50%,#171717_100%)]" />
            <div className="select-none rounded-full bg-black px-3 py-1 text-xs font-medium leading-5 text-slate-200 backdrop-blur-xl">
              I&apos;m almost there // [!code --]
              It&apos;s done // [!code ++]
            </div>
          </span>
        </div>

        <h2 className="text-center text-3xl font-medium text-gray-50 sm:text-6xl">
          New project loading... // [!code --]
          New project&apos;s live! // [!code ++]
        </h2>

        <p className="text-center text-lg leading-6 text-gray-200">
          Setting up and customizing my new web project, integrating tools, and // [!code --]
          applying best practices for a smooth development process. Stay tuned // [!code --]
          for more updates! // [!code --]
          Setting up and customizing my new web project, integrating tools, and // [!code ++]
          applying best practices for a smooth development process. Stay tuned // [!code ++]
          for more updates! // [!code ++]
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

```

And that's it! Our (simplistic) feature to complete the homepage is done.

Run the following commands to stage, commit, and push your local changes to the
`complete-homepage{:.constant.language.undefined}` branch on the remote repository:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Finish homepage feature"
git push origin complete-homepage
```

Before pushing new changes to a remote branch, it's important to run `git pull{:bash}` first. This will ensure that your
local branch is updated with any new changes that may have been pushed to the remote branch by others, especially if
you're working on a team or if your project is open source.

### Open a pull request on the `main{:.constant.language.undefined}` branch

Go to your repository, click on the button displaying **main** with a dropdown icon, and on the displayed list of
branches, click the `complete-homepage{:.constant.language.undefined}` branch. On the
`complete-homepage{:.constant.language.undefined}` branch, your screen should look like this:

![Repository home page screen](/blog/how-to-set-up-a-new-web-project/image-9.webp)

To open a pull request, click on the **Compare & pull request** button or click on the button displaying **Contribute**
with a dropdown icon, and click **Open pull request** from the displayed dropdown. On the next page, you're taken to,
enter a description explaining the changes you've made. Finally, click the **Create pull request** button to open a pull
request on the `main{:.constant.language.undefined}` branch.

### Merge your changes into the `main{:.constant.language.undefined}` branch and delete your feature branch

After clicking the **Create pull request** button, you should be taken to a pull request page. Wait for your CI tests to
complete. After your CI tests are completed, your screen should look like this:

![Repository pull request screen](/blog/how-to-set-up-a-new-web-project/image-10.webp)

Click on the **Merge pull request** button and then click **Confirm merge**. Once the merging is complete, you can
delete your branch by clicking the **Delete branch** button if it's no longer useful.

If you delete your branch on GitHub, then run the following command to delete the
`complete-homepage{:.constant.language.undefined}` branch locally:

```bash
git checkout main
git branch -D complete-homepage
```

And that's it. Go build the next Facebook.

## Conclusion

As a developer, you are often expected to use the automatic installation CLI provided by libraries or frameworks to set
up new web projects. But, sometimes the default options provided by these CLIs may not fully meet your needs or may only
offer a basic template that doesn't align with your desired project configuration. This article provided a comprehensive
guide for customizing the initialization and configuration of your project, either from scratch or by enhancing the
functionality provided by the automatic CLI of your library or framework.

You now have a guide to set up future projects efficiently, consistently, and in a timely fashion. Most importantly, you
understand how each process works. You can either use the step-by-step guide as provided or use it as a foundation to
customize and fit it to your own needs. In any case, the goal is to have a clear system or guide to follow whenever you
start a new project.

Remember, **"hackers hack, crackers crack, and whiners whine. Be a hacker."** Take care.
