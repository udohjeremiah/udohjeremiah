This is the second article (part 2) in my series about **"What You May Not Know About TypeScript."** You might want to
start reading from [part 1](https://www.udohjeremiah.com/blog/what-you-may-not-know-about-typescript-part-1) to get an
introduction to what led me to write this. With that said, let's get started.

## TypeScript checks that you passed the right number of arguments to a function, regardless of using type annotations on parameters or not.

```ts
// With `"noImplicitAny": false` in `tsconfig.json`
function fn(x, y) {
  console.log(x, y);
}

fn(1, 2);
// [!not-code] 1 2

// [!code error:3]
fn(1);
// [!not-code] Expected 2 arguments, but got 1.

// [!code error:3]
fn(1, 2, 3);
// [!not-code] Expected 2 arguments, but got 3.
```

In JavaScript, if you call a function with more arguments than there are parameters, the extra arguments are simply
ignored. TypeScript behaves the same way. Functions with fewer parameters (of the same types) can always take the place
of functions with more parameters:

```ts
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const arrDoubled = arr.map((num) => num * 2); // `(value: number)` => number is assignable to `(value: number, index: number, array: number[]) => number`

console.log(arrDoubled);
// [!not-code] [ 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 ]
```

When writing a function type for a callback, never write an optional parameter unless you intend to call the function
without passing that argument.

## In TypeScript, you can use the `unknown{:ts}` type to describe functions that accept any value without having `any{:ts}` values in your function body.

The `unknown{:ts}` type represents any value. This is similar to the `any{:ts}` type, but is safer because it’s not
legal to do anything with an `unknown{:ts}` value:

```ts
function f1(a: any) {
  a.b(); // OK
}

function f2(a: unknown) {
  // [!code error:3]
  a.b();
  // [!not-code] 'a' is of type 'unknown'.
}
```

Conversely, you can describe a function that returns a value of `unknown{:ts}` type:

```ts
function safeParse(s: string): unknown {
  return JSON.parse(s);
}

// [!code warning:3]
const obj = safeParse("someRandomString");
// [!not-code] Need to be careful with 'obj'!
```

## In TypeScript, you can use the `never{:ts}` type to describe functions that never return a value.

Some functions never return a value:

```ts
function fail(msg: string): never {
  throw new Error(msg);
}
```

The `never{:ts}` type represents values which are never observed. In a return type, this means that the function throws
an exception or terminates execution of the program.

## TypeScript will infer a function's return type based on its `return{:ts}` statements, making return type annotation optional.

Much like variable type annotations, you usually don't need a return type annotation because TypeScript will infer the
function's return type based on its return statements.

```ts
// function getFavoriteNumber(): number
function getFavoriteNumber() {
  return 26;
}
```

Some codebases will explicitly specify a return type for documentation purposes, to prevent accidental changes, or just
for personal preference.

## TypeScript uses contextual typing to automatically provide types for a value depending on the context in which the value was used.

This is very obvious in anonymous functions, which are a little bit different from function declarations. When a
function appears in a place where TypeScript can determine how it's going to be called, the parameters of that function
are automatically given types.

Here's an example:

```ts
const names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Eve"];

// Contextual typing for function - parameter `s` inferred to have type `string`
names.forEach(function (s) {
  console.log(s.toUpperCase());
});

// Contextual typing also applies to arrow functions
names.forEach((s) => {
  console.log(s.toUpperCase());
});
```

Even though the parameter `s{:ts}` didn't have a type annotation, TypeScript used the types of the `forEach{:ts}`
function, along with the inferred type of the array, to determine the type `s{:ts}` will have. This process is called
**"contextual typing"** because the context that the function occurred within informs what type it should have.

## In TypeScript, unlike JavaScript, the inferred type of a function that doesn’t have any return statements, or doesn’t return any explicit value from those return statements is `void{:ts}`.

In JavaScript, a function that doesn't return any value will implicitly return the value `undefined{:ts}`; in
TypeScript, it's inferred type is `void{:ts}`:

```ts
// function noop(): void
function noop() {
  return;
}
```

"But passing `void{:ts}` as an argument to `typeof{:ts}` returns `undefined{:ts}`", you may say. Yes, you're correct,
but `void{:ts}` and `undefined{:ts}` are not the same thing in TypeScript. For example, contextual typing with a return
type of `void{:ts}` does **not** force functions to not return something. Another way to say this is a contextual
function type with a `void{:ts}` return type (`type voidFunc = () => void{:ts}`), when implemented, can return any other
value, but it will be ignored.

Thus, the following implementations of the type `() => void{:ts}` are valid, and when the return value of one of these
functions is assigned to another variable, it will retain the type of `void{:ts}`:

```ts
type voidFunc = () => void;

const f1: voidFunc = () => {
  return true;
};

const f2: voidFunc = () => true;

const f3: voidFunc = function () {
  return true;
};

const v1 = f1();
const v2 = f2();
const v3 = f3();

// [!code error:3]
console.log(!!v1);
// [!not-code] An expression of type 'void' cannot be tested for truthiness

// [!code error:3]
console.log(!!v2);
// [!not-code] An expression of type 'void' cannot be tested for truthiness

// [!code error:3]
console.log(!!v3);
// [!not-code] An expression of type 'void' cannot be tested for truthiness
```

This behavior exists so that the following code is valid even though `Array.prototype.push{:ts}` returns a number and
the `Array.prototype.forEach{:ts}` method expects a function with a return type of `void{:ts}`:

```ts
const src = [1, 2, 3];

const dst = [0];
src.forEach((el) => dst.push(el));

console.log(dst);
// [!not-code] [ 0, 1, 2, 3 ]
```

There is one other special case to be aware of when a literal function definition has a `void{:ts}` return type, that
function must not return anything:

```ts
function f2(): void {
  // [!code error:3]
  return true;
  // [!not-code] Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'void'.
}

const f3 = function (): void {
  // [!code error:3]
  return true;
  // [!not-code] Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'void'.
};
```

## TypeScript requires you to check for `undefined{:ts}` when you read from an optional value before using it.

In JavaScript, if you access a property that doesn't exist, you'll get the value `undefined{:ts}` rather than a runtime
error. Because of this, when you read from an optional property, you'll have to check for `undefined{:ts}` before using
it.

```ts
// Function
function printName(first: string, last?: string) {
  // Might crash if 'last' wasn't provided!
  // [!code error:3]
  console.log(last.toUpperCase());
  // [!not-code] 'last' is possibly 'undefined'.

  if (last !== undefined) {
    console.log(last.toUpperCase()); // OK
  }

  // A safe alternative using modern JavaScript syntax
  console.log(last?.toUpperCase());
}
```

```ts
// Object
function printName(obj: { first: string; last?: string }) {
  // Might crash if 'obj.last' wasn't provided!
  // [!code error:3]
  console.log(obj.last.toUpperCase());
  // [!not-code] 'obj.last' is possibly 'undefined'.

  if (obj.last !== undefined) {
    console.log(obj.last.toUpperCase()); // OK
  }

  // A safe alternative using modern JavaScript syntax
  console.log(obj.last?.toUpperCase());
}
```

## In TypeScript, you can use the non-null assertion operator (postfix`!{:ts}`) to remove `null{:ts}` and `undefined{:ts}` from a type without doing any explicit checking.

Writing `!{:ts}` after any expression is effectively a type assertion that the value isn't `null{:ts}` or
`undefined{:ts}`:

```ts
function liveDangerously(x?: number | null) {
  console.log(x!.toFixed()); // No error
}
```

Just like other type assertions, this doesn't change the runtime behaviour of your code, so it's important to only use
`!{:ts}` when you know that the value can't be `null{:ts}` or `undefined{:ts}`.

## TypeScript will only allow an operation if it is valid for every member of a union in a union type.

A union type is a type formed from two or more other types, representing values that may be any one of those types. We
refer to each of these types as the union's members.

TypeScript will only allow an operation if it is valid for every member of the union. For example, if you have the union
`string | number{:ts}`, you can't use methods that are only available on `string{:ts}`:

```ts
function printId(id: number | string) {
  // [!code error:3]
  console.log(id.toUpperCase());
  // [!not-code] Property `toUpperCase` does not exist on type `string | number`. Property 'toUpperCase' does not exist on type 'number'.
}
```

The solution is to **"narrow"** the union with code, the same as you would in JavaScript without type annotations.
Narrowing occurs when TypeScript can deduce a more specific type for a value based on the structure of the code.

For example, TypeScript knows that only a string value will have a `typeof{:ts}` value `"string"{:ts}`:

```ts
function printId(id: number | string) {
  if (typeof id === "string") {
    // In this branch, `id` is of type 'string'
    console.log(id.toUpperCase());
  } else {
    // Here, `id` is of type 'number'
    console.log(id);
  }
}
```

Sometimes you'll have a union where all the members have something in common. For example, both arrays and strings have
a `slice{:ts}` method. If every member in a union has a property in common, you can use that property without narrowing:

```ts
// function getFirstThree(x: number[] | string): string | number[]
function getFirstThree(x: number[] | string) {
  return x.slice(0, 3);
}
```

## TypeScript type aliases are only aliases - they do not create different/distinct "versions" of the same type.

You can use a type alias to give a name to any type at all. Note that aliases are only aliases - you cannot use type
aliases to create different/distinct "versions" of the same type. When you use the alias, it's exactly as if you had
written the aliased type. In other words, this code might look illegal, but is OK according to TypeScript because both
types are aliases for the same type:

```ts
type UserInputSanitizedString = string;

function sanitize(str: string) {
  // ...
  return str;
}

function sanitizeInput(str: string): UserInputSanitizedString {
  return sanitize(str);
}

// Create a sanitized input
let userInput = sanitizeInput("Hello, world!");

// Can still be re-assigned with a string though
userInput = "new input";
```

## TypeScript's type alias cannot be re-opened to add new properties but an interface is always extendable.

Type aliases and interfaces are very similar, and in many cases, you can choose between them freely. Almost all features
of an `interface{:ts}` are available in `type{:ts}`, the key distinction is that a type cannot be re-opened to add new
properties after it is created (though it can be extended via intersections) vs an interface which is always extendable
either through declaration merging or the `extends{:ts}` keyword.

```ts
// Extending an interface via declaration merging
interface Person {
  name: string;
}

interface Person {
  age: number;
}

const p1: Person = { name: "John Doe", age: 45 };
console.log(p1.name);
// [!not-code] John Doe

console.log(p1.age);
// [!not-code] 45

// Extending an interface via `extends`
interface Animal {
  name: string;
}

interface Bear extends Animal {
  honey: boolean;
}

interface SpecificBear extends Bear, Animal {
  specificAttribute: string;
}

const bear: Bear = { name: "Grizzly", honey: true };
console.log(bear.name);
// [!not-code] Grizzly

console.log(bear.honey);
// [!not-code] true

const specificBear: SpecificBear = {
  name: "Polar",
  honey: false,
  specificAttribute: "Can swim in icy waters",
};
console.log(specificBear.name);
// [!not-code] Polar

console.log(specificBear.honey);
// [!not-code] false

console.log(specificBear.specificAttribute);
// [!not-code] Can swim in icy waters
```

```ts
// Cannot re-open, hence change, a type alias after being created
// [!code error:3]
type Animal = {
  // [!not-code] Duplicate identifier 'Animal'.
  name: string;
};

// [!code error:3]
type Animal = {
  // [!not-code] Duplicate identifier 'Animal'.
  name: string;
  honey: boolean;
};
```

```ts
// Extending a type alias via intersections
type Animal = {
  name: string;
};

type Bear = Animal & {
  honey: boolean;
};

const bear: Bear = { name: "Grizzly", honey: true };
console.log(bear.name);
// [!not-code] Grizzly

console.log(bear.honey);
// [!not-code] true
```

## TypeScript's `interface{:ts}`s, unlike its `type{:ts}`s, may only be used to declare the shapes of objects, not rename primitives.

Using type we can create custom names for existing primitives:

```ts
type SanitizedString = string;
type EvenNumber = number;
```

This isn't feasible with interfaces, as they can only extend other named object types, not primitives:

```ts
// [!code error:3]
interface SanitizedString extends string {}
// [!not-code] An interface cannot extend a primitive type like 'string'. It can only extend other named object types.
```

Which should you use? For the most part, you can choose based on personal preference, and TypeScript will tell you if it
needs something to be the other kind of declaration. If you would like a heuristic, use `interface{:ts}` until you need
to use features from `type{:ts}`.

## In TypeScript, you can use type assertion to specify a more specific type of a value that TypeScript doesn't know about.

Sometimes you will have information about the type of a value that TypeScript can't know about.

For example, if you're using `document.getElementById{:ts}`, TypeScript only knows that this will return some kind of
`HTMLElement{:ts}`, but you might know that your page will always have an `HTMLCanvasElement{:ts}` with a given ID.

In this situation, you can use a type assertion to specify a more specific type:

```ts
const myCanvas = document.getElementById("main_canvas") as HTMLCanvasElement;
```

Like a type annotation, type assertions are removed by the compiler and won't affect the runtime behaviour of your code.

You can also use the angle-bracket syntax (except if the code is in a `.tsx{:ts}` file), which is equivalent:

```ts
const myCanvas = <HTMLCanvasElement>document.getElementById("main_canvas");
```

Reminder: Because type assertions are removed at compile-time, there is no runtime checking associated with a type
assertion. There won't be an exception or `null{:ts}` generated if the type assertion is wrong.

## TypeScript only allows type assertions which convert to a more specific or less specific version of a type.

This rule prevents "impossible" coercions like:

```ts
// [!code error:3]
const x = "hello" as number;
// [!not-code] Conversion of type 'string' to type 'number' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps the other...
```

Sometimes this rule can be too conservative and will disallow more complex coercions that might be valid. If this
happens, you can use two assertions, first to `any{:ts}` (or `unknown{:ts}`), then to the desired type:

```ts
const str = "123";
const num = str as any as number;
```

However, note that converting to a more specific or less specific version of a type won't change the `typeof{:ts}`
value:

```ts
function addOne(num: number) {
  console.log(num + 1);
}

const x = "10" as unknown as number;
console.log(typeof x);
// [!not-code] string

addOne(x);
// [!not-code] 101

const y = "10";
console.log(typeof x);
// [!not-code] string

// [!code error:3]
addOne(x);
// [!not-code] Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.
```

## TypeScript creates types for literals.

In addition to the general types `string{:ts}` and `number{:ts}`, we can refer to specific strings and numbers in type
positions.

One way to consider this is to consider how JavaScript comes with different ways to declare a variable. Both `var{:ts}`
and `let` allow changing what is held inside the variable, and `const{:ts}` does not. This is reflected in how
TypeScript creates types for literals.

```ts
// let changingString: string
let changingString = "Hello World";

// let changingString: string
changingString = "Olá Mundo";

// const constantString: "Hello World"
const constantString = "Hello World";
```

By themselves, literal types aren't very valuable, since it's not much use to have a variable that can only have one
value! But by combining literals into unions, you can express a much more useful concept - for example, functions that
only accept a certain set of known values:

```ts
function printText(s: string, alignment: "left" | "right" | "center") {
  switch (alignment) {
    case "left":
      console.log(`|${s}      |`);
      break;
    case "right":
      console.log(`|      ${s}|`);
      break;
    case "center":
      console.log(`|  ${s}  |`);
      break;
    default:
      console.error("Invalid alignment:", alignment);
      break;
  }
}

printText("Hello, World!", "left");
// [!not-code] |Hello, World!      |

// [!code error:3]
printText("G'day, mate", "centre");
// [!not-code] Argument of type '"centre"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"left" | "right" | "center"'.
```

There's one more kind of literal type: boolean literals. There are only two boolean literal types, and as you might
guess, they are the types `true{:ts}` and `false{:ts}`. The type `boolean{:ts}` itself is actually just an alias for the
union `true | false{:ts}`:

```ts
function toggleSwitch(mode: true | false) {
  return !mode;
}

const m: boolean = true;

console.log(toggleSwitch(m));
// [!not-code] false
```

## TypeScript only infers type literal as a type for a value if it cannot be changed.

When you initialize a variable with an object, TypeScript assumes that the properties of that object might change values
later. For example, if you wrote code like this:

```ts
// const obj: { counter: number; }
const obj = { counter: 0 };

if (!isNaN(obj.counter)) {
  obj.counter = 1;
}
```

TypeScript doesn't assume the assignment of `1{:ts}` to a field that previously had `0{:ts}` is an error. Another way of
saying this is that `obj.counter{:ts}` must have the type `number{:ts}`, not `0{:ts}`, because types are used to
determine both reading and writing behaviour.

The same applies to strings:

```ts
// function handleRequest(url: string, method: "GET" | "POST"): void
declare function handleRequest(url: string, method: "GET" | "POST"): void;

const req = { url: "https://example.com", method: "GET" };

// [!code error:3]
handleRequest(req.url, req.method);
// [!not-code] Argumnet of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter '"GET" | "POST"'.
```

In the above example `req.method{:ts}` is inferred to be `string{:ts}`, not `"GET"{:ts}`. Because code can be evaluated
between the creation of `req{:ts}` and the call of `handleRequest{:ts}` which could assign a new string like
`"GUESS"{:ts}` to `req.method{:ts}`, TypeScript considers this code to have an error.

There are two ways to work around this.

1. You can change the inference by adding a type assertion in either location:

```ts
// Change 1:
const req = { url: "https://example.com", method: "GET" as "GET" };

// Change 2
handleRequest(req.url, req.method as "GET");
```

Change 1 means **"I intend for `req.method{:ts}` to always have the literal type`"GET"{:ts}`"**, preventing the possible
assignment of `"GUESS"{:ts}`to that field after. Change 2 means **"I know for other reasons that `req.method{:ts}` has
the value `"GET"{:ts}`."**

2. You can use `as const{:ts}` to convert the entire object to be type literals:

```ts
const req = { url: "https://example.com", method: "GET" } as const;

handleRequest(req.url, req.method);
```

The `as const{:ts}` suffix acts like `const{:ts}` but for the type system, ensuring that all properties are assigned the
literal type instead of a more general version like `string{:ts}` or `number{:ts}`.

## In TypeScript, you can narrow types to more specific types than declared.

Much like how TypeScript analyzes runtime values using static types, it overlays type analysis on JavaScript's runtime
control flow constructs like `if{:ts}`/`else{:ts}`, conditional ternaries, loops, truthiness checks, etc., which can all
affect those types.

Say, within an `if{:ts}` check, TypeScript sees `typeof padding === "number"{:ts}` and understands that as a special
form of code called a "type guard". TypeScript follows possible paths of execution that our programs can take to
analyze the most specific possible type of a value at a given position. It looks at these special checks
(called **type guards**) and assignments, and the process of refining types to more specific types than declared is
called **narrowing**:

```ts
function padLeft(padding: number | string, input: string): string {
  if (typeof padding === "number") {
    // In this branch, `padding` is of type 'number'
    return " ".repeat(padding) + input;
  }

  // Here, `padding` is of type 'string'
  return padding + input;
}
```

There are a couple of different constructs other than `typeof{:ts}` type guards that TypeScript understands for
narrowing, to keep this article at a readable length I'll link to them since the TypeScript docs explain them very well:

- [Truthiness narrowing](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#truthiness-narrowing)
- [Equality narrowing](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#equality-narrowing)
- [The `in` operator narrowing](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#the-in-operator-narrowing)
- [`instanceof` narrowing](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#instanceof-narrowing)
- [Assignments](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#assignments)
- [Control flow analysis](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#control-flow-analysis)
- [Using type predicates](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#using-type-predicates)
- [Assertion funtions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#assertion-functions)
- [Discriminated Unions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#discriminated-unions)

## TypeScript will use a `never{:ts}` type to represent a state that shouldn’t exist when narrowing.

When narrowing, you can reduce the options of a union to a point where you have removed all possibilities and have
nothing left. In those cases, TypeScript will use a `never{:ts}` type to represent a state which shouldn’t exist, that
is, `never{:ts}` appears when TypeScript determines there's nothing left in a union.

This is very useful in "exhaustiveness checking". The `never{:ts}` type is assignable to every type; however, no
type is assignable to `never{:ts}` (except `never{:ts}` itself). This means you can use narrowing and rely on
`never{:ts}` turning up to do exhaustive checking in a `switch{:ts}` statement.

For example, adding a `default{:ts}` to our `getArea{:ts}` function which tries to assign the shape to `never{:ts}` will
not raise an error when every possible case has been handled:

```ts
interface Circle {
  kind: "circle";
  radius: number;
}

interface Square {
  kind: "square";
  sideLength: number;
}

type Shape = Circle | Square;

function getArea(shape: Shape) {
  switch (shape.kind) {
    case "circle": {
      return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
    }
    case "square": {
      return shape.sideLength ** 2;
    }
    default: {
      const _exhaustiveCheck: never = shape;
      return _exhaustiveCheck;
    }
  }
}
```

Adding a new member to the `Shape{:ts}` union will cause a TypeScript error:

```ts
interface Triangle {
  kind: "triangle";
  sideLength: number;
}

type Shape = Circle | Square | Triangle;

function getArea(shape: Shape) {
  switch (shape.kind) {
    case "circle": {
      return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
    }
    case "square": {
      return shape.sideLength ** 2;
    }
    default: {
      // [!code error:3]
      const _exhaustiveCheck: never = shape;
      // [!not-code] `Type 'Triangle' is not assignable to type 'never'.
      return _exhaustiveCheck;
    }
  }
}
```

## In TypeScript, you can write a construct signature by adding the `new{:ts}` keyword in front of a call signature, creating a constructor that creates a new object.

JavaScript functions can also be invoked with the `new{:ts}` operator. TypeScript refers to these as **constructors**
because they usually create a new object. You can write a construct signature by adding the `new{:ts}` keyword in front
of a call signature:

```ts
type SomeConstructor = {
  new (s: string): unknown;
};

function fn(ctor: SomeConstructor, val: string) {
  return new ctor(val);
}
```

Some objects, like JavaScript's `Date{:ts}` object, can be called with or without `new{:ts}`. You can combine call and
construct signatures in the same type arbitrarily:

```ts
interface CallOrConstruct {
  (n?: number): string;
  new (s: string): Date;
}

function fn(ctor: CallOrConstruct) {
  /**
   * Passing an argument of type `number` to `ctor` matches it against
   * the first definition in the `CallOrConstruct` interface.
   */
  console.log(ctor(10));

  /**
   * Similarly, passing an argument of type `string` to `ctor` matches it
   * against the second definition in the `CallOrConstruct` interface.
   */
  console.log(new ctor("10"));
}

fn(Date);
// [!not-code] Wed May 01 2024 16:26:10 GMT+0100 (West Africa Standard Time)
// [!not-code] 2001-09-30T23:00:00.000Z
```

## In TypeScript, you can pass `undefined{:ts}` when a parameter in a function is optional.

When a parameter is optional (i.e., either it was marked with `?{:ts}` or provided a default), callers can always pass
`undefined{:ts}`, as this simulates a "missing" argument:

```ts
function f(x?: number) {
  console.log(x);
}

f();
// [!not-code] undefined

f(10);
// [!not-code] 10

f(undefined);
// [!not-code] undefined

function g(y = "a") {
  console.log(y);
}

g();
// [!not-code] a

g("b");
// [!not-code] b

g(undefined);
// [!not-code] a
```

This is because once a parameter is marked optional, the parameter will have a union type, where the union members are
the type specified, and `undefined{:ts}`. So, in our example above, `x{:ts}` will be annotated `number | undefined{:ts}`
and `y{:ts}` will be `string | undefined{:ts}`.

## In TypeScript, unlike JavaScript, you can specify a function that can be called in different ways by writing overload signatures.

Some JavaScript functions can be called in a variety of argument counts and types. For example, you might write a
function to produce a `Date{:ts}` that takes either a timestamp (one argument) or a month/day/year specification
(three arguments). To do this in TypeScript, write some number of function signatures (usually two or more), followed by
the body of the function:

```ts
function makeDate(timestamp: number): Date;
function makeDate(m: number, d: number, y: number): Date;
function makeDate(mOrTimestamp: number, d?: number, y?: number): Date {
  if (d !== undefined && y !== undefined) {
    return new Date(y, mOrTimestamp, d);
  } else {
    return new Date(mOrTimestamp);
  }
}

const d1 = makeDate(12345678);
const d2 = makeDate(5, 5, 5);
// [!code error:3]
const d3 = makeDate(1, 3);
// [!not-code] No overload expects 2 arguments, but overloads do exist that expect either 1 or 3 argument.
```

The function(s) without an implementation body are called the **overload signatures**. Then, the function with
implementation is a **compatible signature**. Functions have an implementation signature, but this signature can't be
called directly. This is because the signature used to write the function body can't be "seen" from the outside. So, in
our example above, even though we wrote a function with two optional parameters after the overload signatures, it can't
be called with two parameters!

When writing an overloaded function, you should always have two or more signatures above the function's implementation.
The implementation signature must also be compatible with the overload signatures. For example, these functions have
errors because the implementation signature doesn't correctly match the overloads:

```ts
function fn(x: boolean): void;
// [!code error:3]
function fn(x: string): void;
// [!not-code] This overload signature is not compatible with its implementation signature.

// Should be `fn(x: boolean | string)`
function fn(x: boolean) {
  console.log(x);
}
```

```ts
function fn(x: string): string;
// [!code error:3]
function fn(x: number): boolean;
// [!not-code] This overload signature is not compatible with its implementation signature.

// Should be `fn(x: string | number): string | boolean `
function fn(x: string | number) {
  console.log(x);
}
```

## In TypeScript, unlike JavaScript, you can have a parameter called `this{:ts}`.

The JavaScript specification states that you cannot have a parameter called `this{:ts}`, and so TypeScript uses that
syntax space to let you declare the type for `this{:ts}` in a function body, where the resulting compiled code has
`this{:ts}` removed from the function signature.

TypeScript will infer what the `this{:ts}` should be in a function via code flow analysis. For example, TypeScript
understands that the function `user.becomeAdmin{:ts}` has a corresponding `this{:ts}` which is the outer object
`user{:ts}`:

```ts
const user = {
  id: 123,
  admin: false,
  becomeAdmin: function () {
    this.admin = true;
  },
};

console.log(user.admin);
// [!not-code] false

user.becomeAdmin();

console.log(user.admin);
// [!not-code] true
```

Consider the cases where you need more control over what object `this{:ts}` represents. This is where this feature comes
in:

```ts
interface User {
  id: number;
  admin: boolean;
}

interface DB {
  users: User[];
  filterUsers(filter: (this: User) => boolean): User[];
}

function getDB(): DB {
  const users = Array.from({ length: 10 }).map((_, index) => ({
    id: index,
    admin: !!Math.round(Math.random()),
  }));

  return {
    users,
    filterUsers: function (this: User, filter) {
      return users.filter(function (user) {
        return filter.call(user);
      });
    },
  };
}

const db = getDB();

const admins = db.filterUsers(function (this: User) {
  return this.admin;
});

console.log(admins);
// [!not-code] [
// [!not-code] { id: 3, admin: true },
// [!not-code] { id: 5, admin: true },
// [!not-code] { id: 9, admin: true }
// [!not-code] ]
```

This pattern is common with callback-style APIs, where another object typically controls when your function is called.
Note that you need to use `function{:ts}` and not arrow functions to get this behaviour:

```ts
// [!code error:3]
const admins = db.filterUsers(() => this.admin);
// [!not-code] The containing arrow function captures the global value of 'this'.
```
