## Introduction

Welcome to part 6 of the
[Remix Todo App series](/blog/remix-todo-app-part-1-building-the-app-layout-and-structure#series-roadmap)! This series
covers everything you'll use daily in Remix. In [part 5](/blog/remix-todo-app-part-5-implementing-a-theme-switcher), we
added a theme switcher, allowing users to choose between light and dark themes or sync with their system's preference.

In this part, we'll deploy the app on [Render](https://render.com). While it's not fully production-ready
(it lacks a real database, so tasks aren't saved after closing), it's "deployment-ready". You can share it with family,
friends, and colleagues as a beta version while they await the stable release with personalized and persistent tasks ðŸ˜‰.
Letâ€™s dive in!

## Deploying a Remix App

Deploying a Remix app involves four layers:

1. JavaScript runtime (e.g., Node.js)
2. JavaScript web server (e.g., Express.js)
3. Server adapter (e.g., `@remix-run/express`)
4. Web host or platform

Some web hosts manage multiple layers for you. To deploy Remix with Express.js, you need all four.

Since we initialized this project with `create-remix` without the `--template` flag, we're using the built-in
"Remix App Server," which combines layers 2 and 3. Our runtime is Node.js, and now we need a web host, so we're using
Render.

For more on what each layer does, see the
[Remix docs on deployment](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/discussion/runtimes).

## Deploying on Render

Before deploying, remove the artificial delay from the simulated database in `app/lib/db.server.ts`:

```tsx title="app/lib/db.server.ts" {8-15,22,37,43,63,77,89}#remove
import type { Item, Todo } from "~/types";

/**
 * List of todo items.
 */
const items: Item[] = [];

/**
 * Simulates an artificial delay in async operations to mimic real-world API behaviour.
 * @returns {Promise<void>} A promise that resolves after the delay.
 */
async function simulateDelay(): Promise<void> {
  const ARTIFICIAL_DELAY = 1000;
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, ARTIFICIAL_DELAY));
}

/**
 * An implementation of the `Todo` interface that manages a collection of todo items.
 */
export const todos: Todo = {
  async create(description: string) {
    await simulateDelay();

    const createdTodo: Item = {
      id: Math.random().toString(16).slice(2),
      description,
      completed: false,
      createdAt: new Date(),
    };

    items.push(createdTodo);

    return createdTodo;
  },

  async read() {
    await simulateDelay();

    return items;
  },

  async update(id: string, fields: Partial<Omit<Item, "id" | "createdAt">>) {
    await simulateDelay();

    const itemIndex = items.findIndex((item) => item.id === id);

    if (itemIndex === -1) {
      return undefined;
    }

    const updatedTodo: Item = {
      ...items[itemIndex],
      ...fields,
      completedAt: fields.completed ? fields.completedAt : undefined,
    };

    items[itemIndex] = updatedTodo;

    return updatedTodo;
  },

  async delete(id: string) {
    await simulateDelay();

    const itemIndex = items.findIndex((item) => item.id === id);

    if (itemIndex === -1) {
      return undefined;
    }

    const [deletedTodo] = items.splice(itemIndex, 1);

    return deletedTodo;
  },

  async clearCompleted() {
    await simulateDelay();

    for (let i = items.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      if (items[i].completed) {
        items.splice(i, 1);
      }
    }

    return items;
  },

  async deleteAll() {
    await simulateDelay();

    items.length = 0;
    return items;
  },
};
```

Next, follow these steps to deploy to Render:

- Create a new GitHub repository for the project.

- Push your local repository (if not initialized, run `git init`):

  ```bash
  git remote add origin <your-repository-url>
  git branch -M main
  git push -u origin main
  ```

- Sign up on Render (preferably with GitHub).

- Create a [new Web Service](https://dashboard.render.com/select-repo?type=web) on Render, grant access, and connect it
  to your repository.

- During creation, use the following values:

  | Field         | Values                                                                 |
  | :------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | Language      | `Node`                                                                 |
  | Branch        | `main`                                                                 |
  | Build Command | `npm ci --production=false && npm run build && npm prune --production` |
  | Start Command | `npm start`                                                            |

- Select the "For hobby projects" as the Instance Type.

- Scroll down and click **"Deploy Web Service"**.

That's it! Once the build is complete, your Remix app will be live on your Render URL. No pun intendedâ€”you've just
deployed the first JavaScript todo app in the world that works without JavaScript.

## Conclusion

In this part of the series, you learned how to deploy a Remix app to production on Render. To compare your
implementation with mine, here's the GitHub repository for the series:

deployed URL: [https://remix-todo-app-jrhk.onrender.com](https://remix-todo-app-jrhk.onrender.com).

In the next part, you'll learn how to integrate a database and implement authentication in Remix, allowing users to have
personalized and persistent tasks. Stay tuned!
