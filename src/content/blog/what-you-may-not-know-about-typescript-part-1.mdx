## Introduction

It's April, and I've successfully built a few projects with TypeScript. While working on these projects, a question
would often arise in my mind: "Do you understand TypeScript?" During development, I frequently resorted to my
browser for answers about TypeScript, which made me question if I truly grasped the language beyond using type
annotations, creating interfaces, and type aliasing. Yeah, searching out stuff while you build isn't necessarily wrong,
however, relying too heavily on it for basic aspects of the programming language you're working with, is a sign that you
may need a deeper understanding of the language. I said,
"Enough is enough, it's high time I learn this language from the people building it." TypeScript's documentation was
my next destination.

How did you learn TypeScript to build those projects in the first place? You might ask. I started with the typical
"TypeScript 101" classes from YouTube. After watching a few videos, I felt confident enough to start building.
However, as you know now, I built those projects with pain, an experience I could have avoided if I had taken the time
to learn from the documentation after learning from YouTube. YouTube can only cover so much of the basics needed for
development, and then you find yourself scratching your head while something you thought should work isn't working, and
something you thought shouldn't work is working.

Meticulously reading through TypeScript's documentation to gain a deeper understanding of the language, I found myself
jotting down numerous concepts I was oblivious to during development. Alas, it became clear that the answer to the
recurring question about my understanding of TypeScript was "No". So I thought:
"Why not post about these things you've jotted down? Your future self might need it. Developers sharing a similar
story of how they got into TypeScript might need it. Even the veterans might need it." This blog post was born.

This blog post is just me "copy-pasting" some part of TypeScript's documentation that may not be immediately
apparent to "shallow" users of TypeScript. So, the words are not mine, but those of the numerous contributors to
TypeScript's documentation; I'm only a compiler, heh. However, I added my explanation and examples whenever I thought
the wording from the documentation was verbose, not easily understandable, or lacked a simpler example. To get the most
out of this, treat it as reference material.

## What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is **JavaScript's runtime** with **additional features** and a **compile-time type checker**.

- JavaScript's runtime: Your program would run the same way as it was before you added TypeScript to it. Or said
  another way, TypeScript programs are JavaScript programs with **"types added"**; these types are erased after
  compilation to produce JavaScript programs. This means that your existing working JavaScript code is also TypeScript
  code, and adding types to them won't change the runtime behaviour of your programs.

- Additional features: TypeScript provides additional features to JavaScript, that are not part of the ECMAScript
  language specification, from which JavaScript is built. Some popular examples are tuples and enums. However, you can
  use these features and the compiled code will be valid JavaScript.

- Compile-time type checker: TypeScript as a type checker runs before your code runs (static) and ensures that the
  types of your program are correct (type-checked).

## TypeScript doesn't provide any additional runtime libraries.

This means your programs will use the same standard library (or external libraries) as JavaScript programs, so there's
no additional TypeScript-specific framework to learn.

## In TypeScript, you can use a `tsconfig.json{:.constant.language.undefined}` file to specify the root files and the compiler options required to compile the project.

The presence of a `tsconfig.json{:.constant.language.undefined}` file in a directory indicates that the directory is the
root of a TypeScript project.

The `tsconfig.json{:.constant.language.undefined}` file specifies the root files and the compiler options required to
compile the project. JavaScript projects can use a `jsconfig.json{:.constant.language.undefined}` file instead, which
acts almost the same but has some JavaScript-related compiler flags enabled by default.

Read more about the [tsconfig.json in TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html) from
the documentation.

## TypeScript's core value among others is that much of the time, you will know better than TypeScript.

TypeScript doesn't get in your way, hence by default types are optional, inference takes the most lenient types, there's
no checking for potentially `null{:ts}`/`undefined{:ts}` values, and `tsc{:ts}`, the Typescript compiler, emits the
compiled code in the face of errors. These defaults are put in place to stay out of your way. This is very useful when
migrating JavaScript code over to TypeScript and introducing type-checking errors, as it allows you to clean things up
for the type-checker, while your original JavaScript code is still working.

To be a bit more defensive against mistakes and make TypeScript act a bit more strictly, you can use the several
type-checking strictness flags that can be turned on or off, from using the `--strict{:ts}` flag in the CLI, or
`"strict": true{:ts}` in `tsconfig.json{:.constant.language.undefined}`, which toggles them all on simultaneously, but
you can opt out of them individually. A new codebase should always turn these strictness checks on.

## TypeScript can rewrite code from newer versions of ECMAScript to older ones.

This process of moving from a newer or "higher" version of ECMAScript, say ECMAScript 6, down to an older or "lower" one
say ECMAScript 3 or ECMAScript 5 is sometimes called "downleveling." By default, TypeScript targets ECMAScript 3, an old
version of ECMAScript.

While the default target is ES3, most current browsers support ES2015. Developers can therefore safely specify ES2015,
using the `--target es2015{:ts}` compiler option, or above as a target, unless compatibility with certain ancient
browsers is important.

## TypeScript never changes the runtime behaviour of JavaScript code.

This means that if you move code from JavaScript to TypeScript, it is guaranteed to run the same way, even if TypeScript
thinks the code has type errors.

Consider the example below:

```ts
// let a: any
let a;

// [!code error:3]
if (4 / []) {
  // [!not-code] The right-hand side of an arithmetic operation must be of type 'any', 'number', 'bigint' or an enum type.
  a = Infinity;
} else {
  a = 1;
}

console.log(a);
// [!not-code] Infinity
```

The expression `4 / []{:ts}` in TypeScript would throw an error, however, if you configure your TypeScript settings,
either using compiler flags or in `tsconfig.json{:.constant.language.undefined}`, to allow emitting JavaScript output
despite errors, `a{:ts}` will have the value of `Infinity{:ts}` at runtime, even when TypeScript detects an error.

## TypeScript has corresponding primitive types for the built-in types in JavaScript with a few added ones.

| Type in JavaScript | Type in TypeScript | `typeof{:ts}` return value | Explanation                                    | Predicate                               |
| :----------------- | :----------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `Null{:js}`        | `null{:ts}`        | `"object"{:ts}`            | Equivalent to the unit type.                   |                                         |
| `Undefined{:js}`   | `undefined{:ts}`   | `"undefined"{:ts}`         | Equivalent to the unit type.                   | `typeof undefined === "undefined"{:ts}` |
| `Boolean{:js}`     | `boolean{:ts}`     | `"boolean"{:ts}`           | `true{:ts}` and `false{:ts}`.                  | `typeof b === "boolean"{:ts}`           |
| `Number{:js}`      | `number{:ts}`      | `"number"{:ts}`            | A double-precision IEEE 754 floating point.    | `typeof n === "number"{:ts}`            |
| `BigInt{:js}`      | `bigint{:ts}`      | `"bigint"{:ts}`            | Integers in the arbitrary precision format.    | `typeof m === "bigint"{:ts}`            |
| `String{:js}`      | `string{:ts}`      | `"string"{:ts}`            | `true{:ts}` and `false{:ts}`.                  | `typeof s === "string"{:ts}`            |
| `Symbol{:js}`      | `symbol{:ts}`      | `"symbol"{:ts}`            | A unique value usually used as a key.          | `typeof g === "symbol"{:ts}`            |
| `Object{:js}`      | `object{:ts}`      | `"object"{:ts}`            | Similar to records.                            |                                         |
|                    | `unknown{:ts}`     | `"undefined"{:ts}`         | The top type.                                  |                                         |
|                    | `never{:ts}`       |                            | The bottom type.                               |                                         |
|                    | object literal     | `"object"{:ts}`            | e.g. `{ property: Type }{:ts}`.                |                                         |
|                    | `void{:ts}`        | `"undefined"{:ts}`         | For functions with no documented return value. | `typeof o === "object"{:ts}`            |
|                    | `T[]{:ts}`         | `"object"{:ts}`            | Mutable arrays, also written `Array<T>{:ts}`.  | `Array.isArray(a){:ts}`                 |
|                    | `[T, T]{:ts}`      | `"object"{:ts}`            | Tuples, which are fixed-length but mutable.    | `Array.isArray(a){:ts}`                 |
|                    | `(t: T) => U{:ts}` | `"function"{:ts}`          | functions                                      | `typeof f === "function"{:ts}`          |

## In TypeScript, you can use the `any{:ts}` type to turn off the type checker.

TypeScript uses the type `any{:ts}` whenever it can't tell what the type of an expression should be. It just turns off
the type checker wherever it appears, making you access any properties of a value (which will in turn be of type
`any{:ts}`), call it like a function, assign it to (or from) a value of any type, or pretty much anything else that's
syntactically legal; so it's assumed you know the environment better than TypeScript.

For example, none of the following lines of code will throw compiler errors, as `any{:ts}` disables further type
checking:

```ts
let obj: any = {
  x: 0,
};

obj.foo();
obj();
obj.bar = 100;
obj = "hello";
const n: number = obj;
```

You can push any value into an array with type `any[]{:ts}` without marking the value in any way:

```ts
const anys: any = [];

anys.push(1);
anys.push("oh no");
anys.push({ anything: "goes" });

console.log(anys);
// [!not-code] [ 1, 'oh no', { anything: 'goes' } ]
```

And you can use an expression of type `any{:ts}` anywhere:

```ts
anys.map(anys[1]);
```

`any{:ts}` is contagious, too — if you initialise a variable with an expression of type `any{:ts}`, the variable has
type `any{:ts}` too:

```ts
// let sepsis: any
let sepsis = anys[0] + anys[1];
```

The `any{:ts}` type is useful when you don't want to write out a long type just to convince TypeScript that a particular
line of code is okay.

## TypeScript knows the JavaScript language and will generate types for you in many cases.

In many cases, TypeScript can even just infer (or "figure out") the types for you even if we omit them. This is
known as "types by inference." For example in creating a variable and assigning it to a particular value, TypeScript
will use the value as its type:

```ts
// let helloWorld: string
let helloWorld = "Hello World";

// let obj: {name: string; age: number }
let obj = { name: "John Doe", age: 48 };
```

## TypeScript never changes the behavior of your program based on the types it infers.

This means that while you might see type errors during compilation, the type system itself has no bearing on how your
program works when it runs. It accomplishes this by erasing the types to produce the resulting "compiled" code once
TypeScript's compiler has completely checked your code. Consequently, once your code is compiled, the resulting plain
JavaScript code contains no type information.

For example, the TypeScript code below fails because it contains a duplicate implementation. The compiled code won't
have any type information to determine which function to call at runtime. That is, TypeScript’s type system is not
reified. Therefore, there's nothing at runtime that can tell us whether `num{:ts}` is of type `number{:ts}` or
`string{:ts}`, as the type annotation is not present in any form at runtime.

```ts
// [!code error:3]
function addHundred(num: number) {
  // [!not-code] Duplicate function implementation.
  return num + 100;
}

// [!code error:3]
function addHundred(num: string) {
  // [!not-code] Duplicate function implementation.
  return num + "-hundred";
}
```

The compiled JavaScript code from the above TS code is:

```js
"use strict";
function addHundred(num) {
  return num + 100;
}
function addHundred(num) {
  return num + "-hundred";
}
```

Suppose we push the above JavaScript code to production and call `addHundred(15){:ts}`. Which `addHundred{:ts}`
implementation should be executed at runtime? If you're familiar with JavaScript, you would correctly answer **"It's the
last one."** However, was that what you intended when you wrote the initial TypeScript code? Do you see the point?
Therefore, we can agree that **"It's a bug!"**

## TypeScript does not have a runtime mechanism for identifying the types of values other than primitives.

For some values, such as the primitives `string{:ts}` and `number{:ts}`, we can identify their type at runtime using the
`typeof{:ts}` operator. However, for other things like functions, there's no corresponding runtime mechanism to identify
their types. For example, consider this function:

```ts
function fn(x) {
  return x.flip();
}
```

By reading the code, we can observe that this function will only work if given an object with a callable `flip{:ts}`
property. However, JavaScript doesn't surface this information in a way that we can check while the code is running. The
only way in pure JavaScript to determine what `fn{:ts}` does with a particular value is to call it and see what happens.
This kind of behaviour makes it hard to predict what the code will do before it runs, which means it's harder to know
what your code is going to do while you're writing it.

## TypeScript doesn't consider any JavaScript code to be an error because of its syntax.

This means you can take any working JavaScript code and put it in a TypeScript file without worrying about how it is
written.

```ts
// Works in TS just as it would have in JS
let a = Number("3.1425").toExponential(2);

// Fails in TS just as it would have in JS
// [!code error:3]
let a = (4
// [!not-code] ')' expected.
```

## TypeScript might consider a JavaScript code to be an error because of how a value is used.

TypeScript is a typed superset; hence, it adds rules about how different kinds of values can be used. Therefore, some
syntactically legal programs that would run without an error in JavaScript during runtime might issue an error in
TypeScript during its compile-time type-checking.

Using the code below as an example, in JavaScript, the variable `area{:ts}` would be assigned `NaN{:ts}`, the result
from the operation `obj.width * obj.height{:ts}`; in TypeScript, this results in an error:

```ts
const obj = { width: 10, height: 15 };

// [!code error:3]
const area = obj.width * obj.heigth;
// [!not-code] Property 'heigth' does not exist on type '{ width: number; height: number; }'. Did you mean 'height'?
```

As another example from the code below, in JavaScript, `Infinity{:ts}` would be logged to the console; in TypeScript,
this results in an error:

```ts
// [!code error:3]
console.log(4 / []);
// [!not-code] The right-hand side of an arithmetic operation must be of type 'any', 'number', 'bigint', or an enum type.
```

## In TypeScript, there are only two syntaxes for building types: Interfaces and Types.

```ts
interface Country {
  name: string;
  currency: string;
}

type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};
```

You should prefer `interface{:ts}` over `type{:ts}`. Use `type{:ts}` when you need specific features.

## TypeScript enables creating complex types by combining simple ones.

There are two popular ways to do so: with unions and with generics.

With a union, you can declare that a type could be one of many types. For example, you can describe a `boolean{:ts}`
type as being either `true{:ts}` or `false{:ts}`:

```ts
type WindowStates = "open" | "closed" | "minimized";
type LockStates = "locked" | "unlocked";
type PositiveOddNumbersUnderTen = 1 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 9;
```

Generics provide variables to types. A common example is an array. An array without generics could contain anything. An
array with generics can describe the values that the array contains.

```ts
type StringArray = Array<string>;
type NumberArray = Array<number>;
type ObjectWithNameArray = Array<{ name: string }>;
```

## In TypeScript, for assignability purposes, there's no difference between a type alias and an interface type if they both have the same shape.

Named types simply give a name to a type; for assignability purposes, there's no difference between the type alias
`One{:ts}` and the interface type `Two{:ts}` below. They both have a property `p: string{:ts}`:

```ts
type One = {
  p: string;
};

interface Two {
  p: string;
}

class Three {
  p = "Hello";
}

let x: One = { p: "Hi" };
let two: Two = x;
two = new Three();
```

Type aliases behave differently from interfaces concerning recursive definitions and type parameters, however.

## TypeScript's type system is a structural type system (focuses on the shape that values have) and not a nominal type system (focuses on the name that values have).

Sometimes called "duck typing", in a structural type system, if two objects have the same shape, they are considered to
be of the same type.

```ts
interface Point {
  x: number;
  y: number;
}

function logPoint(p: Point) {
  console.log(`${p.x}, ${p.y}`);
}

const point = { x: 12, y: 26 };

logPoint(point);
// [!not-code] 12, 26
```

The `point{:ts}` variable is never declared to be of type `Point{:ts}`. However, TypeScript compares the shape of
`point{:ts}` to the shape of `Point{:ts}` in the type-check. They have the same shape, so the code passes.

## TypeScript considers objects or classes to match a type if and only if they have all the required properties, regardless of the implementation details.

This is because type compatibility in TypeScript is based on structural subtyping. This means that if an object's shape
matches a type — i.e., if the object's fields have all the required fields of a type, regardless of the order in which
the fields appear or if the object's fields contain other fields not specified in the type — TypeScript will say they
match. For example:

```ts
interface Point {
  x: number;
  y: number;
  z?: number; // optional
}

function logPoint(p: Point) {
  if (p.z) {
    console.log(`x=${p.x}, y=${p.y}, z=${p.z}`);
  } else {
    console.log(`x=${p.x}, y=${p.y}`);
  }
}

// Object's shape matches type exactly
const point1 = { x: 12, y: 26, z: 40 };
logPoint(point1);
// [!not-code] x=12, y=26, z=40

// Object's shape matches type regardless of having a different order of fields
const point2 = { z: 40, x: 12, y: 26 };
logPoint(point2);
// [!not-code] x=12, y=26, z=40

// Object's shape matches type regardless of having fewer properties (i.e., only the required)
const point3 = { x: 12, y: 26 };
logPoint(point3);
// [!not-code] x=12, y=26

// Object's shape matches type regardless of having more than required properties
const point4 = { w: 8, x: 12, y: 26 };
logPoint(point4);
// [!not-code] x=12, y=26

class VirtualPoint {
  x: number;
  y: number;

  constructor(x: number, y: number) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
  }
}

const newVPoint = new VirtualPoint(13, 56);
logPoint(newVPoint);
// [!not-code] x=13, y=56
```

Taking `point4{:ts}` as an example, the object literal `{ w: 8, x: 12, y: 26 }{:ts}` has a matching literal type
`{ w: number, x: number, y: number }{:ts}`. That type is assignable to `{x: number, y: number, z?: number}{:ts}` since
it has all the required properties and those properties have assignable types. The extra property doesn't prevent
assignment; it just makes it a subtype of `{ x: number, y: number, z?: number }{:ts}`. Read more about
[type compatibility in TypeScript from the language's documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/type-compatibility.html).

## TypeScript requires the declaration of type parameters.

Like most C-descended languages, TypeScript requires the declaration of type parameters.

```ts
function liftArray<T>(t: T): Array<T> {
  return [t];
}
```

There is no case requirement, but type parameters are conventionally single uppercase letters. Type parameters can also
be constrained to a type, which behaves a bit like type class constraints:

```ts
function firstish<T extends { length: number }>(t1: T, t2: T): T {
  return t1.length > t2.length ? t1 : t2;
}
```

TypeScript can usually infer type arguments from a call based on the type of the arguments, so type arguments are
usually not needed.

Because TypeScript is structural, it doesn't need type parameters as much as nominal systems. Specifically, they are not
needed to make a function polymorphic. Type parameters should only be used to propagate type information, such as
constraining parameters to be the same type.

```ts
function length<T extends ArrayLike<unknown>>(t: T): number {}

function length(t: ArrayLike<unknown>): number {}
```

In the first `length{:ts}`, `T{:ts}` is not necessary; notice that it's only referenced once, so it's not being used to
constrain the type of the return value or other parameters.

## Conclusion

Remember, **"hackers hack, crackers crack, and whiners whine. Be a hacker."** Take care.
