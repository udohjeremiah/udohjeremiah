## Introduction

This is part 2, a continuation of, the
[Remix Todo App series](/blog/remix-todo-app-part-1-building-the-app-layout-and-structure#series-roadmap). The goal of
this series is to teach you everything about Remix that you'll use on a daily basis. In
[part 1 of this series](/blog/remix-todo-app-part-1-building-the-app-layout-and-structure), we built the layout and
structure of the todo app using HTML and Tailwind CSS.

In this part, we'll discuss three essential concepts in Remix:

- data loading
- data writing
- data reloading

Understanding how these concepts work is crucial to using Remix properly and effectively. Misunderstanding them can lead
to inefficient—or, worse, incorrect—use of Remix.

## Data loading, writing, and reloading

Data loading is the process of retrieving data from a database or API. In Remix, this is managed by a function called a
**loader**. A loader handles [`GET`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET) requests to a route
and can return or throw a response.

Data writing (also called data mutation) is the process of writing to a database or API. In Remix, this is managed by a
function called an **action**. An action handles non-`GET` requests to a route and can return or throw a response.
Non-`GET` requests include [POST](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST),
[PUT](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/PUT),
[PATCH](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/PATCH), and
[DELETE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/DELETE).

Data reloading (also called data revalidation) is the process of re-fetching previously retrieved data to ensure it
reflects any recent changes. In Remix, this happens automatically after any event that might cause a change in data
occurs.

### Data flow in Remix

Remix knows which data to load to build your UI and revalidates it after changes to keep the UI in sync with the
database or API. But when exactly does Remix do this, and how? The process it follows is known as **data flow**.

Below is a flowchart that represents the data flow process:

![Remix data flow](/blog/remix-todo-app/remix-data-flow.webp)

Let's walk through the flowchart in practice. Imagine `example.com` is a Remix app, and you navigate to
`example.com/ayo/tasks`. How you get there matters because Remix uses this to determine how to load the necessary data
for the UI. If any of the following actions occur:

- You open a new browser tab, type in the URL, and hit enter.
- You click the link from another site.
- You click the link within the app rendered using `<Link to="/ayo/tasks" reloadDocument />`.
- You click the link within the app rendered using `<a href="/ayo/tasks">`.
- JavaScript is disabled in your browser.

In any of these cases, Remix treats it as a _document navigation_, meaning it loads the full page. Based on
[Remix's nested routing system](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/discussion/routes), the URL matches multiple routes: the
root route, `/ayo`, and `/ayo/tasks`. Remix will call the loader function for all the matching routes in parallel to
build the UI.

Now, say you navigate from `/ayo/tasks` to `/ayo/tasks/settings`. If the link is rendered using
`<Link to="/ayo/tasks/settings" />` and JavaScript is enabled, Remix treats this as _client-side navigation_. It knows
which params are changing and which layouts will persist between the two URLs. So, it only fetches the data for the
changing layouts (if any) and params (in this case, `settings`) and uses the cached data for the unchanged layouts and
params to update the UI.

As you can see, Remix doesn't always call every loader function. By default, it makes some reliable optimizations. But,
in some cases, it can't optimize because it doesn't have enough information about your code. When this happens, Remix
takes the safest approach and revalidates the data for all matched routes. This ensures the UI stays in sync with the
database or API.

### What triggers data revalidation?

As the flowchart shows, the following events trigger a data revalidation:

- **After a data mutation:** This is obvious, as once a route's action completes, the data in the database or API is
  considered to have changed.
- **The [URL search params](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams) changes:** This triggers a
  reload because any loader on the matched routes could be using those params.
- **The user clicks a link to the same URL they are already on:** This triggers a reload because the click replaces the
  current entry in the browser's history stack.
- **You explicitly requests revalidation using the
  [`useRevalidator`](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/hooks/use-revalidator) hook:** This gives you control over when to
  revalidate the data on the page for reasons beyond the default triggers.

You can **opt out of data revalidation** for specific routes using
[`shouldRevalidate`](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/route/should-revalidate). This allows you to control which routes
should reload data once revalidation is triggered. But, this comes with the risk of your UI falling out of sync with the
database or API, so use it with caution!

### Types of loaders and actions

Web apps can be Multi-Page Applications (MPAs) or Single-Page Applications (SPAs). In MPAs, the browser sends a request
to the server for each new page, causing a full reload. In SPAs, JavaScript handles navigation and updates content
dynamically without a full reload.

Remix can build both MPAs and SPAs. Unlike traditional MPAs, Remix-built MPAs also support client-side routing, like
SPAs. This is achieved through the `<Link>` component. `<Link>` renders a regular `<a>` tag, which works without
JavaScript. With JavaScript enabled, Remix intercepts clicks and handles navigation via client-side routing.

The loader and action functions you define for your routes depend on the type of app you're building. You define a
server `loader` and `action` for a MPA that interacts with a server. You use `clientLoader` and `clientAction` for a SPA
that doesn't involve a server.

#### `loader` and `action`

For MPAs, route modules in Remix have three main exports:

- `loader`: An `async` function that handles data loading, running only on the server.
- `action`: An `async` function that handles data writing, running only on the server.
- A `default` function that reads data from `loader` and `action`, rendering the UI component.

```tsx
export async function loader() {
  // provides data to the component
}

export async function action() {
  // updates persistent data
}

export default function Component() {
  // renders the UI
}
```

The flow after data writes differs slightly depending on whether JavaScript is enabled or disabled. Below is a table
summarizing the differences:

| **Step** | **JavaScript Enabled**                                                                                                                           | **JavaScript Disabled**                                                                           |
| :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1        | `loader` provides data to the `default` component.                                                                                               | `loader` provides data to the `default` component.                                                |
| 2        | `useLoaderData` retrieves data. Remix renders the page server-side and sends HTML to the browser.                                                | `useLoaderData` retrieves data. Remix renders the page server-side and sends HTML to the browser. |
| 3        | When a non-`GET` request is made, Remix sends the request to `action` via [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API). | When a non-`GET` request is made, the browser sends an HTML document request to `action`.         |
| 4        | Pending states are accessible through `useNavigation` and `useFetcher`.                                                                          | Pending states activate via the browser (e.g., spinning favicon).                                 |
| 5        | After `action` completes, `loader` for all matching routes revalidates data.                                                                     | After `action` completes, `loader` for all matching routes revalidates data.                      |
| 6        | `useActionData` returns data from `action`, and `useLoaderData` returns updated values for each matching route. The UI updates accordingly.      | Remix renders the page and sends HTML to the browser.                                             |

#### `clientLoader` and `clientAction`

For SPAs, route modules in Remix also have three main exports:

- `clientLoader`: An `async` function for data loading, running only on the client.
- `clientAction`: An `async` function for data writing, running only on the client.
- A `default` function that reads data from `clientLoader` and `clientAction`, rendering the UI component.

```tsx
export async function clientLoader() {
  // provides data to the component
}

export async function clientAction() {
  // updates persistent data
}

export default function Component() {
  // renders the UI
}
```

Both `clientLoader` and `clientAction` receive the same `params` and `request` arguments as their server counterparts.
You access the returned data using `useLoaderData` and `useActionData`, just like with server `loader` and `action`.
But, `clientLoader` and `clientAction` require JavaScript to operate since they run on the client-side. The flow after
data write is similar to that of server `loader` and `action` when JavaScript is enabled (see table above).

## How to send requests

So far so good, you've learned about data loading, writing, and revalidation in Remix. Loaders handle `GET` requests,
actions handle non-`GET` requests, and Remix manages revalidation. Now, the question is: "How do you send a request?"

If you're familiar with web development, you know the `fetch` API can send HTTP requests, or you might use a library
like [axios](https://axios-http.com) for a simpler API. In Remix, you can still use `fetch` or axios, but Remix offers a
better, more streamlined, and web-standard approach: **HTML forms**. If you choose to forgo Remix's approach and use
`fetch` or axios, you'll need to manage network requests, race conditions, pending states, and data revalidation—things
Remix handles automatically.

In Remix, requests can be declarative, using HTML forms where the user provides values and submits the form, or
imperative, where you as the developer submit the form.

### Declarative approach

In the declarative approach, using an HTML `<form>`, you describe the request and the shape of the data to be
sent. The user then provides values and submits the form.

When the user submits the form, depending on the value of the `method` attribute:

- If `method="get"`: The browser serializes the form's data and appends it to the `action` value with a `?` separator.
  All data on the page is revalidated, and the browser navigates to the resulting URL.

  ```tsx
  /**
   * Default `action` is the current URL (e.g., `localhost:5173`)
   * Default `method` is `"get"`
   * On submit, the browser navigates to `localhost:5173/?first=ayo&last=dele`
   */
  <form>
    <input name="first" value="Ayo" />
    <input name="last" value="Dele" />
    <button>Submit</button>
  </form>
  ```

- If `method="post"`: The browser serializes the form data and sends it in the request body to the action for the route
  specified in the `action` attribute. The route's action processes the request, the page data is revalidated, and the
  browser navigates to the route specified in the `action` attribute.

  ```tsx
  /**
   * Say the current URL is `localhost:5173`
   * On submit, after the `action` processes the request,
   * the browser navigates to `localhost:5173/new`
   */
  <form action="new" method="post">
    <input name="firstName" value="Ayo" />
    <input name="lastName" value="Dele" />
    <button>Submit</button>
  </form>
  ```

Remix offers a `<Form>` component that enhances the HTML `<form>`. Unlike the standard `<form>`, Remix's `<Form>`:

- Allows HTTP methods beyond `GET` and `POST`
- Submits data via `fetch` instead of a document request
- Provides pending states using `useNavigation` instead of showing a spinning favicon

A key difference between `<Form>` and `<form>` is that when the `action` attribute is omitted, `<form>` defaults to the
current URL, while `<Form>` defaults to the route where it's rendered. For consistent behaviour, use
`<Form reloadDocument />` instead of `<form>` if you want to let the browser handle the pending UI, as it behaves like a
native `<form>` but defaults to the route where it's rendered.

### Imperative approach

In the imperative approach, you the developer, not the user, submit the form. You can still define the request and data
structure in the form, allowing the user to input values, or you can manually provide the data. Ultimately, you control
when and how the form is submitted.

Common use cases include:

- Submitting a form when the user selects an item from a dropdown
- Submitting a form after the user completes a task or action
- Submitting a form when a specific condition is met, such as a timer or an external event

To programmatically submit a form in Remix, you use `useSubmit`. This hook submits a form the same way as a
user-initiated submission through a `<Form>`, ensuring it follows the same workflow:

```tsx
import { Form, useSubmit } from "@remix-run/react";

function SomeComponent() {
  const submit = useSubmit();

  // Data can be a `FormData` instance
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append("myKey", "myValue");
  submit(formData, { method: "post" });

  // Or, it can be a plain object that will be serialized as `FormData`
  submit({ myKey: "myValue" }, { method: "post" });

  // Or, a plain object that will be serialized as JSON
  submit({ myKey: "myValue" }, { method: "post", encType: "application/json" });

  // Or, an HTMLFormElement instance where the user provides the value but you do the submission
  <Form
    onChange={(event) => {
      submit(event.currentTarget);
    }}
  />;
}
```

## Building an in-memory database

Now that the theory is out of the way, let's put what we've learned into practice and continue building the todo app.

We'll define a loader and action for the index route to retrieve and create new tasks. We haven't added a database for
reading and writing yet, but we don't need one for now. All we need is to simulate
[CRUD](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CRUD) operations in the app. A simple in-memory database that
loses its data whenever we restart the server will suffice. Let's build it.

Run the following command to create a `app/types.ts` file, which will hold all the TypeScript types for the app:

```bash
touch app/types.ts
```

Now, run the following commands to create a `app/lib/db.server.ts` file, which will contain the code for the simulated
database:

```bash
mkdir -p app/lib && touch app/lib/db.server.ts
```

Copy the following code into `app/types.ts`:

```tsx title="app/types.ts"
/**
 * Represents an individual todo item.
 */
export interface Item {
  /**
   * Unique identifier for the item.
   */
  id: string;

  /**
   * Description of the todo item.
   */
  description: string;

  /**
   * Whether the item is completed.
   */
  completed: boolean;

  /**
   * The date and time when the item was created.
   */
  createdAt: Date;

  /**
   * The date and time when the item was marked as completed. This field is optional and only present if the item is completed.
   */
  completedAt?: Date;

  /**
   * Whether the item is currently being edited. This field is optional.
   */
  editing?: boolean;
}

/**
 * Represents operations that can be performed on todo items.
 * This includes creating, reading, updating, and deleting todo items,
 * as well as clearing completed items or deleting all items.
 */
export interface Todo {
  /**
   * Creates a new todo item.
   * @param {string} description - The description of the new todo item.
   * @returns {Promise<Item>} A promise that resolves to the newly created todo item.
   */
  create: (description: string) => Promise<Item>;

  /**
   * Retrieves all todo items.
   * @returns {Promise<Item[]>} A promise that resolves to an array of todo items.
   */
  read: () => Promise<Item[]>;

  /**
   * Updates an existing todo item by its ID.
   * @param {string} id - The unique identifier of the todo item to update.
   * @param {Partial<Omit<Item, "id" | "createdAt">>} fields - An object containing the fields to update.
   * @returns {Promise<Item | undefined>} A promise that resolves to the updated todo item, or `undefined` if the item was not found.
   */
  update: (
    id: string,
    fields: Partial<Omit<Item, "id" | "createdAt">>,
  ) => Promise<Item | undefined>;

  /**
   * Deletes a todo item by its ID.
   * @param {string} id - The unique identifier of the todo item to delete.
   * @returns {Promise<Item | undefined>} A promise that resolves to the deleted todo item, or `undefined` if the item was not found.
   */
  delete: (id: string) => Promise<Item | undefined>;

  /**
   * Clears all completed todo items.
   * @returns {Promise<Item[]>} A promise that resolves to the updated list of todo items.
   */
  clearCompleted: () => Promise<Item[]>;

  /**
   * Deletes all todo items.
   * @returns {Promise<Item[]>} A promise that resolves to an empty array.
   */
  deleteAll: () => Promise<Item[]>;
}
```

Copy the following code into `app/lib/db.server.ts`:

```tsx title="app/lib/db.server.ts"
import type { Item, Todo } from "~/types";

/**
 * List of todo items.
 */
const items: Item[] = [];

/**
 * Simulates an artificial delay in async operations to mimic real-world API behaviour.
 * @returns {Promise<void>} A promise that resolves after the delay.
 */
async function simulateDelay(): Promise<void> {
  const ARTIFICIAL_DELAY = 1000;
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, ARTIFICIAL_DELAY));
}

/**
 * An implementation of the `Todo` interface that manages a collection of todo items.
 */
export const todos: Todo = {
  async create(description: string) {
    await simulateDelay();

    const createdTodo: Item = {
      id: Math.random().toString(16).slice(2),
      description,
      completed: false,
      createdAt: new Date(),
    };

    items.push(createdTodo);

    return createdTodo;
  },

  async read() {
    await simulateDelay();

    return items;
  },

  async update(id: string, fields: Partial<Omit<Item, "id" | "createdAt">>) {
    await simulateDelay();

    const itemIndex = items.findIndex((item) => item.id === id);

    if (itemIndex === -1) {
      return undefined;
    }

    const updatedTodo: Item = {
      ...items[itemIndex],
      ...fields,
      completedAt: fields.completed ? fields.completedAt : undefined,
    };

    items[itemIndex] = updatedTodo;

    return updatedTodo;
  },

  async delete(id: string) {
    await simulateDelay();

    const itemIndex = items.findIndex((item) => item.id === id);

    if (itemIndex === -1) {
      return undefined;
    }

    const [deletedTodo] = items.splice(itemIndex, 1);

    return deletedTodo;
  },

  async clearCompleted() {
    await simulateDelay();

    for (let i = items.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      if (items[i].completed) {
        items.splice(i, 1);
      }
    }

    return items;
  },

  async deleteAll() {
    await simulateDelay();

    items.length = 0;
    return items;
  },
};
```

That's it! You can review the code if you'd like—it's simple and easy to understand. Essentially, it's an array that
stores tasks and an exported object containing functions to add, update, or delete items from the array.

## Loading tasks into the component

Update `app/routes/_index.tsx` to add the loader function that retrieves tasks from the database and displays them on
the UI:

```tsx title="app/routes/_index.tsx" {2,27} {13}#remove {4,8-10,14}#add
import type { MetaFunction } from "@remix-run/node";
import { Link, json, useLoaderData } from "@remix-run/react";

import { todos } from "~/lib/db.server";

// ...existing code here remains the same

export async function loader() {
  return json({ tasks: await todos.read() });
}

export default function Home() {
  const tasks: string[] = [];
  const { tasks } = useLoaderData<typeof loader>();

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-1 flex-col md:mx-auto md:w-[720px]">
      {/* ...existing code here remains the same */}

      <main className="flex-1 space-y-8">
        {/* ...existing code here remains the same */}

        <div className="rounded-3xl border border-gray-200 bg-white/90 px-4 py-2 dark:border-gray-700 dark:bg-gray-900">
          {tasks.length > 0 ? (
            <ul>
              {tasks.map((task) => (
                <li key={task.id}>{task.description}</li>
              ))}
            </ul>
          ) : (
            <p className="text-center leading-7">No tasks available</p>
          )}
        </div>

        {/* ...existing code here remains the same */}

        {/* ...existing code here remains the same */}
      </main>

      {/* ...existing code here remains the same */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

We returned the response from `loader` using the `json` utility from Remix, which simplifies creating `application/json`
responses. Alternatively, we could've constructed the full response using a
[Fetch Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response):

```tsx
return new Response(JSON.stringify({ task: await todos.read() }), {
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "applications/json; charset=utf-8",
  },
});
```

## Adding new tasks

Update `app/routes/_index.tsx` to add the action that writes to the database to create new tasks:

```tsx title="app/routes/_index.tsx" {1-2} {10-17,28-31,45}#add {27,44}#remove
import type { ActionFunctionArgs, MetaFunction } from "@remix-run/node";
import { Form, Link, json, useLoaderData } from "@remix-run/react";

import { todos } from "~/lib/db.server";

// ...existing code here remains the same

// ...existing code here remains the same

export async function action({ request }: ActionFunctionArgs) {
  const formData = await request.formData();

  const { description } = Object.fromEntries(formData);
  await todos.create(description as string);

  return json({ ok: true });
}

export default function Home() {
  const { tasks } = useLoaderData<typeof loader>();

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-1 flex-col md:mx-auto md:w-[720px]">
      {/* ...existing code here remains the same */}

      <main className="flex-1 space-y-8">
        <form className="rounded-full border border-gray-200 bg-white/90 shadow-md dark:border-gray-700 dark:bg-gray-900">
        <Form
          method="post"
          className="rounded-full border border-gray-200 bg-white/90 shadow-md dark:border-gray-700 dark:bg-gray-900"
        >
          <fieldset className="flex items-center gap-2 p-2 text-sm">
            <input
              type="text"
              name="description"
              placeholder="Create a new todo..."
              required
              className="flex-1 rounded-full border-2 border-gray-200 px-3 py-2 text-sm font-bold text-black dark:border-white/50"
            />
            <button className="rounded-full border-2 border-gray-200/50 bg-gradient-to-tl from-[#00fff0] to-[#0083fe] px-3 py-2 text-base font-black transition hover:scale-105 hover:border-gray-500 sm:px-6 dark:border-white/50 dark:from-[#8e0e00] dark:to-[#1f1c18] dark:hover:border-white">
              Add
            </button>
          </fieldset>
        </form>
        </Form>

        {/* ...existing code here remains the same */}

        {/* ...existing code here remains the same */}

        {/* ...existing code here remains the same */}
      </main>

      {/* ...existing code here remains the same */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

We updated `<form>` to `<Form>` to set the form's action URL to the route it's rendered on and changed the request
method from `GET` to `POST` for mutations. Then, we added an `action` to handle the request. In the action, we retrieved
the form data, extracted the task description, created a new todo item, and returned a success JSON response. To test,
enter a task and submit the form, and your new task should appear in the list. Huzzah!

## Conclusion
