## Introduction

Alright, peeps, gather around for Ufuoma's tech journey. So, picture this – Ufuoma jumps into the web dev scene in his
late twenties. Fast forward four months, he's conquered HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, proudly wearing the "web developer"
badge. Keen to level up, he takes on React.js (spoiler: because it's the cool kid in town 😎). After a month of
wrestling with React.js docs (that's 5 months in the tech arena), Ufuoma emerges a React.js maestro.

Now, hold onto your hats, 'cause here's where it gets spicy. Following the age-old advice for self-taught devs, he's
told, "Build a killer portfolio and dive into the job hunt." But wait, there's a plot twist – someone throws in the idea
of adding a blog section to the website. You know, so he can spill the beans on his coding journey
(spoiler alert: it doesn't end well, and you'll find out why). Ufuoma, all pumped up, sees the magic in
blogging – "I'ma soar high," he declares.

Long story short, cut to a year later, and Ufuoma's blogging buzz has hit a speed bump. Even with a bit of self-coaxing
to write, he's waving the white flag, questioning the whole blogging gig. What went wrong? Well, folks, buckle
up – we're about to find out why Ufuoma's tech blog dream ain't all sunshine and rainbows.

## The Exacts - NO Sugar-Coating

(No beating around the bush here. If you're expecting a research paper on "blogging," sorry, mate, wrong stop. We're
skipping the fluff and diving right into the nitty-gritty: where blogging came from, what it was all about in the
beginning, and what the heck it means today.)

### Where Exactly Did Blogging Come From?

Let's time-travel before "blogging" was a word. The late 1990s coined the term, but the blog saga has a backstory.

#### Digital Hangouts

Before blogs took center stage, digital communities were the cool kids. [Usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet),
[GEnie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEnie), BiX, and early [CompuServe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CompuServe)
formed the clique. [Email lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_mailing_list) and
[Bulletin Board Systems (BBS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_Board_System)
[Internet forums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum) like [WebEx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebEx)
threaded conversations, creating a virtual corkboard vibe.

Usenet, a digital hotspot, featured moderated newsgroups. Users summarized discussions, birthing gems like
[rec.humor.funny](https://groups.google.com/group/rec.humor.funny) (1987). Enter
[Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee), the web's architect, who crafted what's considered the
first blog in 1992 while building the World Wide Web.

#### Diary Days

Blogging's roots? [Online diaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_diary)! Legends like
[Justin Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Hall) and
[Jerry Pournelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Pournelle) paved the way.
[Dave Winer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Winer), a syndication guru, played his part. "Weblog" was born in 1997,
and Peter Merholz coined "blog" in '99. Platforms like [Open Diary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Diary) and
[Blogger](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger_(service)>) set the stage.

#### News and Politics Spotlight

Come 2001, political blogs emerged, influencing [Trent Lott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Lott)'s resignation
in 2002. Blogs broke [Iraq War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq) stories, shaping news narratives.
Liveblogging became a thing, giving instant reactions to events.

#### Outreach and Opinions

2004 marked blogs' mainstream arrival in politics. They weathered [Rathergate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rathergate)
and earned media trust. Blogs went global during the
[2004 Tsunami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake) and
[Hurricane Katrina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina).
[Fortune](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(magazine)>) recognized business bloggers in 2005.

#### Changing Times

By 2012, [Evan Williams](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Williams_(Internet_entrepreneur)>) introduced
[Medium](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_(website)>), shifting blogging's role. In today's hazy blogging-social
media scene, some predicted blogs' demise. Yet, with 500 million+ blogs worldwide in 2019, the blog pulse beats strong,
even if some platforms play data hide-and-seek.

### What Exactly is a Blog?

So, what's this "blog" fuss about? A blog is like a regularly updated online hub, dishing out insights on a specific
topic. Think of it as an info platform, spiced up with informal diary-style text entries.
(By the way, I won't cry if you don't agree; data's got my back 😐). Now, no matter what fancy term you prefer, a blog
boils down to these basics:

- It's a website.
- It spills the beans on a particular topic.
- It rocks that laid-back diary-style vibe with text entries.
- It gets a makeover regularly.

Got it so far? Now, here's the real talk: that social media account where you drop daily wisdom bombs or your Twitter
feed with its tweet parade? Nope, they're not blogs. Best we'd call them is a "socialog" 🤷🏿‍♂️. You can love it or hate it,
but that's the cold, hard truth!

### Who Exactly is a Blogger?

So, who wears the blogger hat? Well, it's pretty simple: a blogger is the maestro behind a blog. End of story! It could
be a lone wolf handling everything from crafting the website to dropping knowledge bombs in blog posts. Alternatively,
it might be a wordsmith on a team of blogging maestros. 🎩✨

### Why Exactly Do People Blog?

Let's cut through the fluff and hit the nail on the head. According to the
[2017 blogging industry report by convertkit.com](https://convertkit.com/reports/blogging/), bloggers find their joy in
creative expression, clocking in at a massive 73%. At the same time, when it comes to feeling successful, money takes
the crown at another impressive 73%. So, why do people embark on the blogging journey? Well, it's a dynamic duo:
showcasing their true (or fake 🤷🏿‍♂️) selves to the world and raking in some sweet cash
(because, let's face it, humans don't dive into anything without a sprinkle of self-interest, right? 😂).

### Where Will Your Blog Journey Take You?

So, you're diving into the blogging world—cool move! It's not just about letting your creative juices flow; it's like
opening a door to a bunch of cool stuff:

- Express yourself creatively
- Share what you know like a pro
- Dive deeper into your interests
- Connect with an awesome audience
- Become a big shot in your field
- Boost your brand game
- Unlock cool partnerships and growth opportunities
- Make that moolah
- Enjoy working from wherever
- Be your own boss
- Start that dream company
- Find your dream job, maybe
- Do your bit for global issues
- Or, you know, venture into something wild

The future of blogging, if it's still a thing, is this mix of being creative, having a purpose, and making some sweet
cash.

## The Inexacts - Unmasking the Deceptions

Hey, sorry for the theory overload; I know it can be a snoozefest. But, let's spill the beans on Ufuoma and the whole
"you need a blog" advice he got.

- **"Keep a journal with a blog."**
- **"Blogging is a breeze."**
- **"Coder? Start a blog, they said."**
- **"To be a better web dev, blog away."**
- **"Teach right after learning, they said."**
- **"Teach programming through your blog; be a programming guru, they said."**
- **"Blogging: learn and share at the same time."**
- **"Your code and docs get a facelift with a blog."**
- **"Passive income? Yeah, blog for it."**
- **"Blogging boosts your confidence."**
- **"The ghost coder? Nah, anonymity can ruin your career."**
- **"Market yourself with a blog; show off your quirks and beliefs."**
- **"Collaborate with devs through blogging."**
- **"Bosses love a blogging employee."**
- **"Blogs swing open doors to opportunities."**
- **"Code blog = authority in your field."**
- **"Blog to be a voice in the tech community."**
- **"Blogging: the express route to learning."**
- **"Build connections via your blog."**
- **"Tech switcharoo? Blog about it."**
- **"Bump up your luck by blogging."**
- **"Spot knowledge gaps through your blog."**
- **"Write like a champ; your blog's the stage."**
- **"Grab attention with your blog spotlight."**
- **"Every dev should blog; it's the understanding litmus test."**
- **"Need a learning hub? Blog it out, accessible from anywhere."**
- **"Tech talk to life talk - evolve with your blog."**

There's more, but no worries—I won't drown you in it. A quick Google search spills all these beans. Turns out, many of
these ideas don't hold up for programmer bloggers like Ufuoma. He bought into the hype without checking it out himself,
and there's more juice to this story. Stick around! 🚀

## The Reality

### The Real Deal

Alright, let's break it down before we dive deep:

1. Your jam is being a PROGRAMMER, not some fancy BLOGGER. PROGRAMMERS sling code to build cool software, while BLOGGERS
   whip up content for folks to devour. Both deal with writings, but the vibe and mission are totally different.

2. Talking about programmers blogging in the real world is like comparing real-world open source to the tech industry's
   daydream. It's a whole different ball game, my friend.

### Types of Bloggers - Programmers Fit Nowhere

Alright, let's untangle this web. Ufuoma got steered wrong, and he's not the only one. Newbie programmers often hear the
same spiel: "Start a blog." But where in the blogosphere do they fit? If you pop the question, chances are they'd opt
for KEEPING A JOURNAL, not running a blog. Now, let's dive into the blog-o-sphere and break down the types:

- **Hobby bloggers** (newbies blogging for fun): Picture this - personal or hobby blogs, where folks aren't in it for
  the cash. It's a creative outlet, sharing life stories, honing skills, or keeping the fam in the loop.

- **Side hustle bloggers**: Next on the blogging menu, the side hustlers. They aim for a profitable niche blog, juggling
  other life commitments. Regular posts, money-making plans, and a balancing act.

- **Full-time bloggers**: Last but not least, the full-timers. These bloggers splash the cash upfront, envisioning their
  blog as a moneymaking venture.

Now, I dropped the bomb - "Programmers fit nowhere." Closest shot? **Hobby bloggers.** But hold up, it's not all about
fun for us. We're on a mission - sharing tech wisdom with our fellow code wranglers. Yet, here's the kicker: everyone
preaching consistency (my so-called 'fun') forgets it's no cakewalk. Writing regularly for an audience? That's no
picnic.

So, where do the blogging gurus in the coding realm fit? Brace yourself - they're mostly full-time bloggers
(moonlighting as freelancers) or side-hustle heroes (juggling a 9-to-5). They rake in blog bucks and are in a perpetual
growth sprint. Got it now? You've been fed a line, just like Ufuoma. Stick around; there's more truth to unveil. 🚀

### Ditching the fallacies

Alright, let's unravel the yarn of blogging advice for programmers. We're about to expose why these common reasons was
not the golden ticket for coders like Ufuoma:

#### Blogging to Keep Your Journal

So, a journal, by definition, just means
"your personal record of what's going down, your experiences, and thoughts jotted down regularly; basically, your diary."
Throwing in "personal" doesn't really change much, because a journal is already supposed to be "personal." But here's
the kicker: the same folks telling you to keep a personal journal and preach "just write for yourself to get better"
also tell you to dive into online marketing. Why? Because, according to them, for your blog to hit the big leagues, you
gotta market it. Seriously? Why am I marketing something meant for my eyes only? The reality is, no one starts a "blog"
just for themselves. We humans, being the social creatures we are, blog to share ideas, connect with others, and maybe
make some cash while we're at it. That's not what a personal journal is about, so let's not mix up the two.

If there's one thing to take away from this article, it's this: a personal journal isn't a blog; a teaching course isn't
a blog; and content writing isn't a blog. Frankly, most developers shouldn't bother with blogging; they should keep a
handy logbook (or call it a personal journal, or "prolog") to jot down their latest wins and lessons. Teach some courses
on platforms like [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), and all that jazz. A blog should have one purpose: putting
yourself out there for the world to see. If that's not your vibe, then skip the whole blogging scene, my friend.

#### Blogging is easy

Here's some statistics for you to see:

- There are 600 million blogs among 1.9 billion websites worldwide in 2024.
- These blogs produce 7.5 million blog posts daily.
- The majority of bloggers are in the United States.
- English is the top blogging language, with 48% of WordPress websites using it as their primary language. With over
  600 miilion blogs in the world, that's nearly a third of all 1.9 billion webistes on the internet (31.6%).
- These blogs generate a whopping 7.5 million blog posts per day - that's over 2.7 billion pieces of content per year.
- The latest avaialable data indicates that 7.7 million read blogs.

According to the
[2017 blogging industry report by convertkit.com](https://convertkit.com/reports/blogging/), the most popular seven blog
topics (the least of which is covered by more than 20% of bloggers) are:

1. Personal development,
2. Entrepreneurship,
3. Small business,
4. Online business,
5. Productivity,
6. Marketing, and
7. Lifestyle design

Where does programming comes in? Software is eating the world they say, but still the world only cares about the
finished software, not the nitty-gritty of pullling the software together (the code - programming). You get the picture?
You're entering a world that's hard already (and for the most part they don't care about your field; and even when they
are, they might not be in your niche). Taking the above into account, you must accept that blogging can’t be treated as
something you do on the side, for good old fun. It will require hard work if you want to triumph. A successful blogger
knows this -and he keeps at it, pushing out quality and polishing it to perfection.

As with many other things in life, if you want to have a successful blog, you can’t treat blogging as a hobby or a side
project. Blogging requires you to be consistent and dedicated. This means that you must produce quality content that’s
imminently shareable on social media–and produce it often. Add this to your daily life of family time, job time,
learning time and other things related to programming, how is this easy?

#### To become a better web developer, you should start a blog

Seriously? Juggling a job, finding time to learn, and staying ahead in a world that never takes a breather—it's a real
challenge. And don't even get me started on those of us with families (big shout-out to the wife and kids) who also
deserve some quality time. So, where on earth do they think we'll magically uncover three spare hours a day to write and
publish every week? I mean, c'mon! We're spinning plates with family, work, learning, open source projects, and being
the superhero for fellow coders in our stack – it's a full-on juggling act!

Let's cut through the noise. Blogging, among all the things that supposedly make us better programmers, doesn't quite
hit the mark, if it even does anything at all. Ever notice that many of the web wizards out there aren't really
bloggers? They've just figured out how to connect with their work buddies and keep steering things in the right
direction. So, this whole idea is seriously flawed. Becoming a top-notch dev is about immersing yourself in more code,
tackling trickier problems, and that's the real deal! End of story!

#### Teach programming through your blog to become a better programmer

So, here's the real talk: when folks dive into the programming world to learn something fresh, they're hitting up
documentation, snagging a course, or binge-watching YouTube tutorial series (stats back this up). But guess what?
They're not sitting down with a cup of coffee to read a blog (seriously, let that thought marinate for a sec). People
aren't flocking to your blog for a deep dive into the whole shebang. More likely, if they do drop by, it's for some
quick "how-to" fix to zap a problem and maybe grab a bit more understanding if you seem like a legit expert in the
field. So, kill the notion that you're the prof teaching a class via your blog. Spoiler alert: you're really not.

Still not buying it? Well, the stats say the average reader clocks in at a whopping 52 seconds per blog post. What posts
rack up the most eyeballs? You guessed it—those with titles like "How," "What," "Why," and "Best." Words like 'your' hit
right at the visitor's own problems (whoops, this blog post missed that memo 🥲).
[According to SEMRUSH](https://semrush.com/blog/anatomy-of-top-performing-articles/), listicles
(those articles starting with a number like "17 Types of Blog Posts") score double the traffic. Let that sink
in—listicles snag 80% more eyeballs than other article types. Now you get it, right? These blog posts are all about
tossing info straight at the reader, not some scholarly research material. And hey, users often bounce if that's your
game.

#### A coding blog helps build authority in your field

Let's clear this up real quick: Linus Torvalds is a legend not because he blogs but because he birthed the Linux
Operating System. Dan Abramov isn't a big deal in programming circles because of his blog; it's because he's the
backbone of React.js, the go-to frontend framework. Take our pal Jeff Atwood, the guy behind blog.codinghorror.com – his
authority isn't from blogging but from creating Stack Overflow and Discourse. Think of any top-notch programmer you look
up to, quote, and admire, and I'll bet they've crafted some open or closed-source software that's making life easier for
us (doesn't have to be massive, but a solid bunch of people are using it). No one really gives two hoots about your
blog; let's be honest here.

Even Jeff Atwood, the most cited programmer who blogs, wouldn't be on anyone's radar if he hadn't birthed Stack Overflow
and Discourse. The harsh reality is, devs give you the nod of authority based on what you've built that's smoothing out
their development life; your blog isn't stealing the spotlight. Truth bomb – WE REALLY DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU, or let's
put it gently, USERS JUST DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU.

#### Blogging will give you have a voice in the community

Ugh, not this old tale again. Let's bury this once and for all: Right now, as you're reading this, hit the pause button
and try to recall just one programmer who's got your attention solely because they're a stellar blogger. Just one, where
the only reason they're on your radar is that they blog like a champ. I bet it's a head-scratcher, just like it is for
me. The big shots in the tech/programming realm? They're the ones we admire because they've either crafted killer
software, been part of the team crafting it, or they're the wizards teaching us how to do it by rolling up their sleeves
and doing it themselves. So, bid farewell to this piece of advice and put your focus on slinging code and building
top-notch software for the people.

#### Uncover gaps in your knowledge through your blog

Alright, let's break this down a bit. While there's some truth to this, it's not the whole picture. Us developers really
dig into learning when faced with new projects that force us to create something entirely fresh or tackle uncharted
territory; that's been the go-to for most programmers. Sure, if we're talking general knowledge, I'm on board. But in
the realm of programming, it's all about code, code, code – that's how we wrap our heads around new stuff
(even those things we pick up from books, they don't stick until we get our hands dirty building with them). Wanna bet
the challenges and curveballs you face while trying to whip up a simple demo for a blog post are like night and day
compared to building a real-world application for production? That's where the real curveballs, the ones not even
covered in books and docs, come into play.

#### A blog creates a nice passive side-income stream that you wouldn't otherwise have

Listen up, your gig is PROGRAMMING, not blogging. The folks raking in big bucks from blogging? They're more like
content-creator programmers and less like the full-time code warriors grinding away at a company. Any seasoned
programmer will tell you that coding comes with its own set of headaches – adding blogging to the mix? No thanks.

Sure, keeping up with blogging might crank up your blog's traffic. But that means you'll have to up your game in
promoting yourself, whether that's on your socials, through guest posts, or by picking up some tricks from the seasoned
pros.

Wanna throw in my two cents? Here it is: as a programmer, why not try selling a course, giving a programming tutorial,
or snagging some medium to low-stakes freelancing gigs? These are solid ways to score that sweet passive side-income
without the hassle of blogging.

#### Every developer should make a habit of blogging about their learnings; it's a litmus test for understanding

Let's be real, do you automatically consider someone an expert just because they blog their heart out about something?
I'd be shocked if you said yes. In our world, we judge experts based on what they've actually built or accomplished, not
just on what they yap about. That's programming for you: actions speak louder than words. Sure, teaching can showcase
your grasp of a concept, but coding? It's too darn abstract for anyone to talk a big game about an algorithm and then
totally fumble when it comes to actually putting it into code.

So yeah, blogging about a subject doesn't automatically make you a master at it. At least that's the vibe in the
programming world. The real masters? They're the ones out there crafting and building software with their mad skills,
not just shooting the breeze. Linus Torvalds, the genius behind the Linux Operating System, summed it up perfectly:
"Talk is cheap. Show me the code."

#### Employers love it when you blog

Alright, let's dive into this. Marc Andreessen puts it plain and simple:
[we will be judged by what we – and our code – have done](http://pmarchive.com/how_to_hire_the_best_people.html), not by
all the chit-chat swirling around it.

Now, here's the deal: unless your company's all about open-source software, you don't exactly have free rein to blog
about what goes down at work. So, by default, you're kinda limited in what you can spill about your job. But here's the
kicker: employers tend to dig it when you blog. Why? Because it shows 'em you're a valuable asset, someone who can whip
up killer articles and content for their blogs. It's like a little dance of missed personal interests: they want you to
blog about them, while you wanna talk about yourself. Sadly, when it comes to putting food on the table, they usually
win.

#### From a technical space to a blog discussing technology, careers, leadership, and life – you can evolve with your blog

Alright, let's wrap this up before we end up with a novel! Let's tackle one last misconception. If you think there are
other myths we haven't addressed yet, drop a comment, and we'll make sure to cover it. And hey, if you reckon these
aren't really myths, shoot us a comment too, and we'll link it here for everyone to check out the other side of the
coin.

Now, back to debunking. Here's the scoop: it's no secret that programmers who rake in the cash aren't just chatting
about code. Nope, they're diving into all sorts of topics. Some dive into the wide world of technology, others dish
about the nitty-gritty of life in the programming lane, and then there are those who spill the beans on blogging in the
coding world. Oh, and let's not forget the ones dishing out tips on how to boss it as a leader and entrepreneur in the
programming realm.

So, if you're aiming to make bank from your blog, you gotta branch out beyond just code talk
(kinda like what I'm doing right now 😄). 'Cause let's face it, if you're sticking to your tech stack playbook, you're
not gonna reel in a huge crowd. Catchin' on to the drift here? It's a whole different ball game than what you've been
told.

## Conclusion

Alright, if Ufuoma is up for a read and cool enough to own up to his blunders, maybe backtrack a bit to figure out where
things went south and make amends, here's my two cents:

- Get into crafting awesome open-source projects that tackle real problems, either in your specific field or for the
  greater good.
- Dive deep into open source – contribute actively to projects that align with your interests.
- Hang out in developer communities; think StackOverflow, Discord groups, Slack Channels,
  [WebDeveloper](https://webdeveloper.com/), [Dev.to](https://dev.to/) – wherever the tech crowd chills.
- Be a hero to newbies. Answer their burning questions on these platforms and guide them through the coding maze.
- Link up with fellow developers on LinkedIn – it's like Facebook but for serious business-minded people.
- And, if time allows (and the cash seems appealing), dip your toes into blogging. Remember, you're not doing it just
  for kicks (hobby blogging is kinda not a thing for us programmers), but more as a side gig.

Now, I can't hand you a foolproof manual on the right moves to make (the list above is basically my take on things). If
I had that magic formula, I'd be rolling in dough right now. Bottom line – figure out what advice clicks with you. And
seriously, do some digging before you plunge into anything that could devour more than 3 hours a day
(that's a whopping 1095 hours a year, and you definitely don't want to flush that time down the drain).
