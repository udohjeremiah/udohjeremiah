## Introduction

Whenever you decide to adopt a new web framework, there are two questions youÂ *must*Â answer:

- Where will I start learning from?
- When will I know if I've learned enough to start building?

The answer to the first question is often straightforward: the framework's documentation. You read the docs, and you get
first-hand knowledge from the framework's creators of how it works.

To the second question, there is no simple answer. Frameworks often include a "Getting Started" or "Introduction"
section on their docs. They do this to give new users a taste of how things work and familiarize them with the basics.
But such information isn't enough to build a full-fledged app. To learn how to do so, you're expected to dive deeper
into the docs.

Still, in search of an answer to the second question, you're now faced with theseÂ options:

- Read the docs to the end. Once you've finished, you'llÂ presumablyÂ have learned everything necessary to start building.
- Watch tutorials on YouTube to learn how the framework is used to build real-world apps.
- Read the codebase of open-source apps using the framework, and learn how they used it.

While each option has pros and cons, they don't address the question:Â **_what is enough?_**Â This is what this article
series answers for the [Remix web framework](https://remix.run).

In this article series, we'll build a real-world todo app with Remix. And, by the end of the series, you'll have learned
80% of the Remix concepts you'll use daily to build real-world apps. For the other 20%, you should consult _the doctor_
(i.e. [the docs](https://remix.run/docs) ðŸ˜‰).

## Series roadmap

The goal of the series is to teach youÂ *everything*Â about Remix that you'll use on a daily basis. To ensure you can
follow this series at a good pace, it's broken down into seven parts.

- [Part 7 - Integrating a database and adding authentication](/blog/remix-todo-app-part-7-integrating-a-database-and-adding-authentication)

### Technologies in use

- Remix as the full-stack web framework
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) for type safety
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling the app
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) as the database
- [Render](https://render.com)Â for deploying the app

## Prerequisites

This series assumes you have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. For your development
environment, it assumes you have Node.js and Git installed. If not, I recommend familiarizing yourself with and
installing these technologies before proceeding.

## Generating the Remix app

There are three ways to initialize a Remix project:

- From the [`create-remix` CLI](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/other-api/create-remix) with the `--template` flag. You
  provide a [template](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/tree/main/templates) or
  [stack](https://github.com/topics/remix-stack) from the official or community ones. Templates are minimal starting
  points to get you up and running. Stacks are templates that are more complete and closer to production-ready
  architectures.
- From the `create-remix` CLI without the `--template` flag. You get a basic template using the built-in
  [Remix App Server](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/other-api/serve). The Remix App Server is a production-ready, but
  basic Node.js server built with Express.
- From scratch where you set up everything yourself. You install the runtime and development dependencies and set up the
  necessary configurations.

If you're a complete beginner to Remix, you should initialize from scratch. This will help you understand everything the
`create-remix` CLI does to set up your project. I've written an article on
[how to set up a Remix project from scratch](/blog/how-to-set-up-a-new-web-project), so give it a read if you need to.

Once you understand how things work, you should initialize using a template. It's the easiest and fastest way to get
your Remix app started and ready to deploy, saving you time. If the template doesn't fully meet your needs, you can
[customize the initialization](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/guides/templates#customize-initialization) or modify the
generated project.

For this app, the basic template is enough to get started. Run the following command in your terminal to generate a
Remix project:

```bash
npx create-remix@latest
```

Once completed, open the project in your code editor. Then, run the following command to start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

That's it! You're ready to start building.

## Building the app layout and structure

Before writing any code, let's look at a sketch of the UI we'll building.

![Todo app UI sketch](/blog/remix-todo-app/app-sketch.webp)

A todo app helps you manage a list of tasks you want to complete. While the UI might seem minimalistic, it covers the
essential features every todo app should have:

- Ability to add tasks
- View all tasks, including when they were added and completed
- Mark tasks as completed
- Edit tasks to correct errors
- Delete tasks no longer needed
- Clear completed tasks
- Delete all tasks at once
- View only active or completed tasks

The app isÂ *minimalistic*Â but notÂ *simplistic*.

To start, delete all the code from `tailwind.config.ts` and replace it with the following:

```ts title="tailwind.config.ts"
import type { Config } from "tailwindcss";

export default {
  content: ["./app/**/{**,.client,.server}/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      fontFamily: {
        system: [
          "-apple-system",
          "BlinkMacSystemFont",
          "Segoe UI",
          "Roboto",
          "Oxygen",
          "Ubuntu",
          "Cantarell",
          "Open Sans",
          "Helvetica Neue",
          "sans-serif",
          "Apple Color Emoji",
          "Twemoji Mozilla",
          "Segoe UI Emoji",
          "Segoe UI Symbol",
          "Noto Color Emoji",
          "EmojiOne Color",
          "Android Emoji",
        ],
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
} satisfies Config;
```

Then, delete all the code from `app/tailwind.css` and replace it with the following:

```css title="app/tailwind.css"
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Next, delete all the code from `app/root.tsx` and replace it with the following:

```tsx title="app/root.tsx"
import {
  Links,
  Meta,
  Outlet,
  Scripts,
  ScrollRestoration,
} from "@remix-run/react";

import "./tailwind.css";

export function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html
      lang="en"
      className="bg-white/90 font-system antialiased dark:bg-gray-900"
    >
      <head>
        <meta charSet="utf-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
        <Meta />
        <Links />
      </head>
      <body className="flex min-h-screen max-w-[100vw] flex-col overflow-x-hidden bg-gradient-to-r from-[#00fff0] to-[#0083fe] px-4 py-8 text-black dark:from-[#8E0E00] dark:to-[#1F1C18] dark:text-white">
        {children}
        <ScrollRestoration />
        <Scripts />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  return <Outlet />;
}
```

Finally, delete all the code from `app/routes/_index.tsx` and replace it with the following:

```tsx title="app/routes/_index.tsx"
import type { MetaFunction } from "@remix-run/node";
import { Link } from "@remix-run/react";

export const meta: MetaFunction = () => {
  return [
    { title: "Todo App" },
    {
      name: "description",
      content: "A minimalistic todo app built with Remix.",
    },
  ];
};

export default function Home() {
  const tasks: string[] = [];

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-1 flex-col md:mx-auto md:w-[720px]">
      <header className="mb-12 flex items-center justify-between">
        <h1 className="text-4xl font-extrabold tracking-tight lg:text-5xl">

          <option>Dark</option>

      </header>

      <main className="flex-1 space-y-8">
        <form className="rounded-full border border-gray-200 bg-white/90 shadow-md dark:border-gray-700 dark:bg-gray-900">

actual colors and animations.

## Conclusion

In this part of the series, you've learned the different ways to generate a Remix app. You initialized a Remix app using
a template, got it up and running, and updated it with the layout and structure of the todo app we're building. You'll
build on this foundation as the series progresses.

In the next part, you'll learn how data loading and mutations work in Remix. This will enable you to load tasks from a
database and add new tasks. Stay tuned!
