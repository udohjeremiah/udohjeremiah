This is the third article (part 3) in my series about **"What You May Not Know About TypeScript."** You might want to
start reading from [part 1](https://www.udohjeremiah.com/blog/what-you-may-not-know-about-typescript-part-1) to get an
introduction to what led me to write this. With that said, let's get started.

## In TypeScript, a property in an object type can be marked as `readonly{:ts}`, which makes re-writing to it during type-checking an error.

Properties can also be marked as `readonly{:ts}` for TypeScript. While it won't change any behaviour at runtime, a
property marked as `readonly{:ts}` can’t be written to during type-checking:

```ts
interface SomeType {
  readonly prop: string;
}

function doSomething(obj: SomeType) {
  // We can read from 'obj.prop'.
  console.log(`prop has the value '${obj.prop}'.`);

  // But we can't re-assign it.
  // [!code error:3]
  obj.prop = "hello";
  // [!not-code] Cannot assign to 'prop' because it is a read-only property.
}
```

Using the `readonly{:ts}` modifier doesn't necessarily imply that a value is immutable or that its internal contents
can't be changed. It just means the property itself can't be re-written to:

```ts
interface Home {
  readonly resident: { name: string; age: number };
}

function visitForBirthday(home: Home) {
  // We can read and update properties from 'home.resident'.
  console.log(`Happy birthday ${home.resident.name}!`);
  home.resident.age++;
}

function evict(home: Home) {
  // But we can't write to the 'resident' property itself on a 'Home'.
  // [!code error:3]
  home.resident = {
    // [!not-code] Cannot assign to 'resident' because it is a read-only property.
    name: "Victor the Evictor",
    age: 42,
  };
}
```

## In TypeScript, `readonly{:ts}` properties in an object type can change via aliasing.

It's important to manage expectations of what `readonly{:ts}` implies. It's useful to signal intent during development
time for TypeScript on how an object should be used. TypeScript doesn't factor in whether properties on two types are
`readonly{:ts}` when checking whether those types are compatible, so `readonly{:ts}` properties can also change via
aliasing:

```ts
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

interface ReadonlyPerson {
  readonly name: string;
  readonly age: number;
}

let writablePerson: Person = {
  name: "Person McPersonface",
  age: 42,
};

// works
let readonlyPerson: ReadonlyPerson = writablePerson;
console.log(readonlyPerson.age);
// [!not-code] 42

writablePerson.age++;
console.log(readonlyPerson.age);
// [!not-code] 43

writablePerson.age = 10;
console.log(readonlyPerson.age);
// [!not-code] 10
```

## In TypeScript, you can use an index signature to describe the types of possible values.

Sometimes you don't know all the names of a type's properties ahead of time, but the shape of the values you do know. In
those cases, you can use an index signature to describe the types of possible values. Only some types are allowed for
index signature properties: `string{:ts}`, `number{:ts}`, `symbol{:ts}`, template string patterns, and union types
consisting only of these:

```ts
interface StringArray {
  [index: number]: string;
}

const myArray: StringArray = ["a", "b", "c"];

const secondItem = myArray[1];
console.log(typeof secondItem);
// [!not-code] string

// [!code error:3]
const thirdItem = myArray["b"];
// [!not-code] Element implicitly has an 'any' type because index expression is not of type 'number'.
```

Above, we have a `StringArray{:ts}` interface which has an index signature. This index signature states that when a
`StringArray{:ts}` is indexed with a `number{:ts}`, it will return a `string{:ts}`.

You can make index signatures `readonly{:ts}` to prevent assignment to their indices:

```ts
interface StringArray {
  readonly [index: number]: string;
}

const myArray: StringArray = ["a", "b", "b"];

// [!code error:3]
myArray[2] = "c";
// [!not-code] Index signature in type 'StringArray' only permits reading.
```

You can’t set `myArray[2]{:ts}` because the index signature is `readonly{:ts}`.

## In TypeScript, string index signatures enforce that all properties match their return type.

While string index signatures are a powerful way to describe the "dictionary" pattern, they also enforce that all
properties match their return type. This is because a string index declares that `obj.property{:ts}` is also available
as `obj["property"]{:ts}`. In the following example, `name{:ts}`'s type does not match the string index's type, and the
type checker gives an error:

```ts
interface NumberDictionary {
  [index: string]: number;
  length: number; // ok
  // [!code error:3]
  name: string;
  // [!not-code] Property 'name' of type 'string' is not assignable to 'string' index type 'number'.
}
```

However, properties of different types are acceptable if the index signature is a union of the property types:

```ts
interface NumberOrStringDictionary {
  [index: string]: number | string;
  length: number; // ok, length is a number
  name: string; // ok, name is a string
}
```

## In TypeScript, if an object literal has any properties that the "target type" doesn't have, you'll get an error.

Where and how an object is assigned a type can make a difference in the type system. One of the key examples of this is
in excess property checking, which validates the object more thoroughly when it is created and assigned to an object
type during creation.

Consider the code below:

```ts
interface SquareConfig {
  color?: string;
  width?: number;
}

function createSquare(config: SquareConfig): { color: string; area: number } {
  return {
    color: config.color || "red",
    area: config.width ? config.width * config.width : 20,
  };
}

// [!code error:3]
let mySquare = createSquare({ colour: "red", width: 100 });
// [!not-code] Object literal may only specify known properties, but 'colour' does not exist in type 'SquareConfig'. Did you mean to write 'color'?
```

Notice the given argument to `createSquare{:ts}` is spelled `colour{:ts}` instead of `color{:ts}`. In plain JavaScript,
this sort of thing fails silently. You could argue that this program is correctly typed, since the `width{:ts}`
properties are compatible, there's no `color{:ts}` property present, and the extra `colour{:ts}` property is
insignificant.

However, TypeScript takes the stance that there's probably a bug in this code. Object literals get special treatment and
undergo excess property checking when assigning them to other variables, or passing them as arguments. If an object
literal has any properties that the "target type" doesn’t have, you'll get an error, as shown above.

Getting around these checks is simple. The easiest method is to use a type assertion:

```ts
let mySquare = createSquare({ colour: "red", width: 100 } as SquareConfig);
```

However, a better approach might be to add a string index signature if you're sure that the object can have some extra
properties that are used in some special way. If `SquareConfig{:ts}` can have `color{:ts}` and `width{:ts}` properties
with the above types, but could also have any number of other properties, then we could define it like so:

```ts
interface SquareConfig {
  color?: string;
  width?: number;
  [propName: string]: any;
}
```

Here we're saying that `SquareConfig{:ts}` can have any number of properties, and as long as they aren't `color{:ts}` or
`width{:ts}`, their types don't matter.

One final way to get around these checks, which might be a bit surprising, is to assign the object to another variable.
Since assigning `squareOptions{:ts}` won't undergo excess property checks, the compiler won't give you an error:

```ts
let squareOptions = { colour: "red", width: 100 };
let mySquare = createSquare(squareOptions);
```

The above workaround will work as long as you have a common property between `squareOptions{:ts}` and
`SquareConfig{:ts}`. In this example, it was the property `width{:ts}`. It will however, fail if the variable does not
have any common object property.

For example:

```ts
let squareOptions = { colour: "red" };
// [!code error:3]
let mySquare = createSquare(squareOptions);
// [!not-code] Type '{colour: string; }` has no properties in common with 'SquareConfig'.
```

Keep in mind that for simple code like the above, you probably shouldn't be trying to "get around" these checks. For
more complex object literals that have methods and hold state, you might need to keep these techniques in mind, but a
majority of excess property errors are actually bugs.

That means if you're running into excess property checking problems for something like option bags, you might need to
revise some of your type declarations. In this instance, if it's okay to pass an object with both a `color{:ts}` or
`colour{:ts}` property to `createSquare{:ts}`, you should fix up the definition of `SquareConfig{:ts}` to reflect that.

## TypeScript provides a `ReadonlyArray{:ts}` special type that describes arrays that shouldn’t be changed.

```ts
function doStuff(values: ReadonlyArray<string>) {
  // We can read from 'values'
  const copy = values.slice();
  console.log(`The copied array is ${copy}`);

  // ...but we can't mutate 'values'.
  // [!code error:3]
  values.push("hello!");
  // [!not-code] Property 'push' does not exist on type 'readonly string[]'.
}
```

Much like the `readonly{:ts}` modifier for properties, it's mainly a tool we can use for intent. When we see a function
that returns `ReadonlyArray{:ts}`s, it tells us we're not meant to change the contents. When we see a function that
consumes `ReadonlyArray{:ts}`s, it tells us that we can pass any array into that function without worrying that it will
change its contents.

Unlike `Array{:ts}`, there isn't a `ReadonlyArray{:ts}` constructor that we can use.

```ts
// [!code error:3]
new ReadonlyArray("red", "green", "blue");
// [!not-code] 'ReadOnlyArray' only refers to a type, but is being used as a value here.
```

Instead, we can assign regular `Array{:ts}`s to `ReadonlyArray{:ts}`s.

```ts
const roArray: ReadonlyArray<string> = ["red", "green", "blue"];
```

Just as TypeScript provides a shorthand syntax for `Array<Type>{:ts}` with `Type[]{:ts}`, it also provides a shorthand
syntax for `ReadonlyArray<Type>{:ts}` with `readonly Type[]{:ts}`.

```ts
function doStuff(values: readonly string[]) {
  // We can read from 'values'...
  const copy = values.slice();
  console.log(`The copied array is ${copy}`);

  // ...but we can't mutate 'values'.
  // [!code error:3]
  values.push("hello!");
  // [!not-code] Property 'push' does not exist on type 'readonly string[]'.
}
```

One last thing to note is that, unlike the `readonly{:ts}` property modifier, assignability isn't bidirectional between
regular `Array{:ts}`s and `ReadonlyArray{:ts}`s.

```ts
let x: readonly string[] = [];
let y: string[] = [];

x = y;
// [!code error:3]
y = x;
// [!not-code] The type 'readonly string[]' is 'readonly' and cannot be assigned to the mutable type 'string[]'.
```

## TypeScript provides a `readonly{:ts}` tuple type

Tuple types have `readonly{:ts}` variants, and can be specified by sticking a `readonly{:ts}` modifier in front of them,
just like with array shorthand syntax.

```ts
function doSomething(pair: readonly [string, number]) {
  // ...
  console.log(pair);
}
```

As you might expect, writing to any property of a `readonly{:ts}` tuple isn't allowed in TypeScript.

```ts
function doSomething(pair: readonly [string, number]) {
  // [!code error:3]
  pair[0] = "hello!";
  // [!not-code] Cannot assign to '0' because it is a read-only property.
}
```

Tuples tend to be created and left un-modified in most code, so annotating types as `readonly{:ts}` tuples when possible
is a good default. This is also important given that array literal with `const{:ts}` assertions will be inferred with
`readonly{:ts}` tuple types.

```ts
let point = [3, 4] as const;

function distanceFromOrigin([x, y]: [number, number]) {
  return Math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2);
}

// [!code error:3]
distanceFromOrigin(point);
// [!not-code] Argument of type 'readonly [3, 4]' is not assignable to parameter of type '[number, number]' ...
```

Here, `distanceFromOrigin{:ts}` never modifies its elements but expects a mutable tuple. Since `point{:ts}`'s type was
inferred as `readonly [3, 4]{:ts}`, it won't be compatible with `[number, number]{:ts}` since that type can't guarantee
`point{:ts}`'s elements won't be mutated.

## TypeScript's type system allows expressing types in terms of other types.

This is very powerful. We have a wide variety of type operators available to use. It's also possible to express types in
terms of values that we already have.

By combining various type operators, we can express complex operations and values in a succinct, maintainable way. Below
are the ways to express a new type in terms of an existing type or value and to keep this blog post at a readable length
I'll just link to them since the TypeScript docs explains them very well:

  property in an existing type

  which change properties via template literal strings

## TypeScript, unlike JavaScript, does not analyze methods you invoke from a class constructor to detect initializations, hence fields needs to be initialized in the constructor itself.

Normally, fields in a class can have initializers, and these will run automatically when the class is instantiated; and
just like with `const{:ts}`, `let{:ts}`, and `var{:ts}`, the initializer of a class property will be used to infer its
type:

```ts
class Point {
  // No need to annotate `x` and `y` with the type `number` as it will be inferred
  x = 0;
  y = 0;
}

const pt = new Point();
console.log(`${pt.x}, ${pt.y}`);
// [!not-code] 0, 0

// [!code error:3]
pt.x = "0";
// [!not-code] Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'
```

However, the `strictPropertyInitialization{:ts}` setting can be turned on to make TypeScript check for class properties
that are declared but not set in the constructor. When this is done, for a class field declared but not initialized,
TypeScript will issue an error, requesting it is initialized in the class constructor:

```ts
class BadGreeter {
  // [!code error:3]
  name: string;
  // [!not-code] Property 'name' has no initializer and is not definitely assigned in the constructor.
}

class GoodGreeter {
  name: string;

  constructor() {
    this.name = "hello";
  }
}
```

However, note that this initialization must be done explicitly in the constructor, and not from a method, as TypeScript
doesn't analyze methods you invoke from a class constructor to detect initializations. This is because a derived class
might override those methods and fail to initialize the members:

```ts
// This would work in JavaScript but fails in TypeScript
class BadGreeter {
  // [!code error:3]
  name: string;
  // [!not-code] Property 'name' has no initializer and is not definitely assigned in the constructor

  constructor() {
    this.greet();
  }

  greet() {
    this.name = "hello";
    console.log(this.name);
  }
}
```

If you intend to definitely initialize a field through means other than the constructor
(for example, maybe an external library is filling in part of your class for you), you can use the definite assignment
assertion operator, `!{:ts}`.

```ts
class OKGreeter {
  // Not initialized, but no error
  name!: string;
}
```

## In TypeScript, class fields may be prefixed with the `readonly{:ts}` modifier. This prevents assignments to the field outside of the constructor.

```ts
class Greeter {
  readonly name: string = "world";

  constructor(otherName?: string) {
    if (otherName !== undefined) {
      this.name = otherName;
    }
  }

  err() {
    // [!code error:3]
    this.name = "not ok";
    // [!not-code] Cannot assign to 'name' because it is a read-only property.
  }
}

const g = new Greeter();
// [!code error:3]
g.name = "also not ok";
// [!not-code] Cannot asign to 'name' because it is a read-only property.
```

## TypeScript treats class constructors as very similar to functions: you can add parameters with type annotations, default values, and overloads.

```ts
class Point {
  x: number;
  y: number;

  // Normal signature with defaults
  constructor(x = 0, y = 0) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
  }
}
```

```ts
class Point {
  x = 0;
  y = 0;
  s = "";

  // Overloads
  constructor(x: number, y: number);
  constructor(s: string);
  constructor(xs: number | string, y?: number) {
    if (typeof xs === "number") {
      this.x = xs;
      this.y = y || 0;
    } else {
      this.s = xs;
    }
  }
}

let obj1 = new Point(1, 2);
let obj2 = new Point("1");
```

There are just a few differences between class constructor signatures and function signatures:

- Constructors can't have type parameters - these belong on the outer class declaration
- Constructors can't have return type annotations - the class instance type is always what's returned

## In TypeScript, methods can use all the same type annotations as functions and constructors.

A function property on a class is called a method. Other than the standard type annotations, TypeScript doesn’t add
anything else new to methods:

```ts
class Point {
  x = 10;
  y = 10;

  scale(n: number): void {
    this.x *= n;
    this.y *= n;
  }
}
```

Note that inside a method body, it is still mandatory to access fields and other methods via `this.{:ts}`. An
unqualified name in a method body will always refer to something in the enclosing scope:

```ts
let x: number = 0;

class C {
  x: string = "hello";

  m() {
    // This is trying to modify 'x' declared outside the class, not the class property
    // [!code error:3]
    x = "world";
    // [!not-code] Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'
  }
}
```

## TypeScript has some special inference rules for accessors i.e. getters and setters.

Classes can also have accessors:

```ts
class C {
  _length = 0;

  get length() {
    return this._length;
  }

  set length(value) {
    this._length = value;
  }
}

const myInstance = new C();
console.log(myInstance.length);
// [!not-code] 0

imyInstancens.length = 20;
console.log(myInstance.length);
// [!not-code] 20
```

TypeScript has some special inference rules for accessors:

- If `get{:ts}` exists but no `set{:ts}`, the property is automatically `readonly{:ts}`
- If the type of the setter parameter is not specified, it is inferred from the return type of the getter
- Getters and setters must have the same Member Visibility

Note that a field-backed `get{:ts}`/`set{:ts}` pair with no extra logic is rarely useful in JavaScript. It's fine to
expose public fields if you don’t need to add additional logic during the get/set operations.

Since TypeScript 4.3, it is possible to have accessors with different types for getting and setting:

```ts
class Thing {
  _size = 0;

  get size(): number {
    return this._size;
  }

  set size(value: string | number | boolean) {
    let num = Number(value);

    // Don't allow NaN, Infinity, etc
    if (!Number.isFinite(num)) {
      this._size = 0;
      return;
    }

    this._size = num;
  }
}

const myInstance = new Thing();
console.log(myInstance.size);
// [!not-code] 0

myInstance.size = true;
console.log(myInstance.size);
// [!not-code] 1
```

## In TypeScript, classes can declare index signatures; these work the same as index signatures for other object types.

```ts
class MyClass {
  [s: string]: boolean | ((s: string) => boolean);

  check(s: string) {
    return this[s] as boolean;
  }
}

const myInstance = new MyClass();

myInstance["foo"] = true;
myInstance["bar"] = (s: string) => s.length > 3;

console.log(myInstance.check("foo"));
// [!not-code] true

console.log(myInstance.check("bar"));
// [!not-code] [Function (anonymous)]

console.log(myInstance.check("baz"));
// [!not-code] undefined
```

Because the index signature type needs to capture the types of methods, it's not easy to use these types. Generally,
it's better to store indexed data in another place, instead of on the class instance itself.

## In TypeScript, you can use an `implements{:ts}` clause to check that a class satisfies a particular `interface{:ts}`.

An error will be issued if a class fails to implement an `interface{:ts}` correctly:

```ts
interface Pingable {
  ping(): void;
}
```

```ts
// Correct
class Sonar implements Pingable {
  ping() {
    console.log("ping!");
  }
}
```

```ts
// Wrong
// [!code error:3]
class Ball implements Pingable {
  // [!not-code] Class 'Ball' incorrectly implements interface 'Pingable'.
  pong() {
    console.log("pong!");
  }
}
```

```ts
// Correct
class Ball implements Pingable {
  ping() {
    console.log("ping!");
  }

  pong() {
    console.log("pong!");
  }
}
```

Classes may also implement multiple interfaces, e.g. `class C implements A, B {{:ts}`.

## In TypeScript, an `implements` clause is only a check that the class can be treated as the `interface{:ts}` type, it doesn’t change the class's type or its methods.

A common source of error is to assume that an `implements{:ts}` clause will change the class type - it doesn't!

```ts
interface Checkable {
  check(name: string): boolean;
}

class NameChecker implements Checkable {
  // With `"noImplicitAny": false` in `tsconfig.json`
  check(s) {
    // Notice no error here
    return s.toLowerCase() === "ok";
  }
}
```

In the above example, we perhaps expected that `s{:ts}`'s type would be influenced by the `name: string{:ts}` parameter
of `check{:ts}`; It didn't. `implements{:ts}` clauses don't change how the class body is checked or its type inferred.

## In TypeScript, implementing an interface with an optional property doesn't create that property.

```ts
interface A {
  x: number;
  y?: number;
}

class C implements A {
  x = 0;
}

const c = new C();
// [!code error:3]
c.y = 10;
// [!not-code] Property 'y' does not exist on type 'C'.
```

## TypeScript, unlike JavaScript, enforces that a derived class is always a subtype of its base class.

For example, here's a legal way to override a method:

```ts
class Base {
  greet() {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
  }
}

class Derived extends Base {
  greet(name?: string) {
    if (name === undefined) {
      super.greet();
    } else {
      console.log(`Hello, ${name.toUpperCase()}`);
    }
  }
}

const d = new Derived();
d.greet();
// Hello, world!

d.greet("reader");
// Hello, READER
```

It's important that a derived class follow its base class contract. Remember that it's very common (and always legal!)
to refer to a derived class instance through a base class reference:

```ts
// Alias the derived instance through a base class reference
const b: Base = d;
// No problem
b.greet();
```

What if `Derived{:ts}` didn't follow Base's contract?

```ts
// This would work in JavaScript but fails in TypeScript
class Base {
  greet() {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
  }
}

class Derived extends Base {
  // Make this parameter required
  // [!code error:3]
  greet(name: string) {
    // [!not-code] Property 'greet' in type 'Derived' is not assignable to the same property in base type 'Base'.
    console.log(`Hello, ${name.toUpperCase()}`);
  }
}
```

If we compiled this code despite the error, this sample would then crash:

```ts
const b: Base = new Derived();
// [!code warning:3]
b.greet();
// [!not-code] Crashes because "name" will be undefined
```

## Conclusion

Remember, **"hackers hack, crackers crack, and whiners whine. Be a hacker."** Take care.
