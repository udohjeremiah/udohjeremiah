        Serendipity is alive and well online‚Äîit wears the face of a stray link,
        a mistyped search, a forgotten tab, a friend's repost, or a midnight
        scroll that led you somewhere you didn't know you needed to go.

        Bill Gates once wrote in 1999 that the Internet was becoming the town
        square for the global village of tomorrow. I don't think it's "becoming"
        anymore ‚Äî it is!

        This page exists to help me keep track of links to things I've read and
        liked on the internet. You can call them my
        <i>"all-time favourite things on the internet."</i> I know, I know ‚Äî browsers
        have this feature ü§ß. I've tried using it before, but it just doesn't work
        for me. A change of laptop or uninstalling a browser is enough to make me
        lose them ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
